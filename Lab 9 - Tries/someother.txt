gulliver is my ancient andintimate friend there is likewise some relation between us on themothers side  about three years ago mr gulliver growing weary of theconcourse of curious people coming to him at his house in redriff made asmall purchase of land with a convenient house near newark innottinghamshire his native country where he now lives retired yet ingood esteem among his neighboursalthough mr gulliver was born in nottinghamshire where his fatherdwelt yet i have heard him say his family came from oxfordshire toconfirm which i have observed in the churchyard at banbury in thatcounty several tombs and monuments of the gulliversbefore he quitted redriff he left the custody of the following papers inmy hands with the liberty to dispose of them as i should think fit  ihave carefully perused them three times  the style is very plain andsimple and the only fault i find is that the author after the mannerof travellers is a little too circumstantial  there is an air of truthapparent through the whole and indeed the author was so distinguishedfor his veracity that it became a sort of proverb among his neighboursat redriff when any one affirmed a thing to say it was as true as ifmr gulliver had spoken itby the advice of several worthy persons to whom with the authorspermission i communicated these papers i now venture to send them intothe world hoping they may be at least for some time a betterentertainment to our young noblemen than the common scribbles ofpolitics and partythis volume would have been at least twice as large if i had not madebold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tidesas well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyagestogether with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship instorms in the style of sailors likewise the account of longitudes andlatitudes wherein i have reason to apprehend that mr gulliver may be alittle dissatisfied  but i was resolved to fit the work as much aspossible to the general capacity of readers  however if my ownignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes ialone am answerable for them  and if any traveller hath a curiosity tosee the whole work at large as it came from the hands of the author iwill be ready to gratify himas for any further particulars relating to the author the reader willreceive satisfaction from the first pages of the book                                                          richard sympsona letter from captain gulliver to his cousin sympson                        written in the year i hope you will be ready to own publicly whenever you shall be called toit that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me topublish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels with directionsto hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in orderand correct the style as my cousin dampier did by my advice in hisbook called a voyage round the world  but i do not remember i gave youpower to consent that any thing should be omitted and much less that anything should be inserted therefore as to the latter i do here renounceevery thing of that kind particularly a paragraph about her majestyqueen anne of most pious and glorious memory although i did reverenceand esteem her more than any of human species  but you or yourinterpolator ought to have considered that it was not my inclinationso was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before mymaster houyhnhnm and besides the fact was altogether false for to myknowledge being in england during some part of her majestys reign shedid govern by a chief minister nay even by two successively the firstwhereof was the lord of godolphin and the second the lord of oxford sothat you have made me say the thing that was not  likewise in theaccount of the academy of projectors and several passages of mydiscourse to my master houyhnhnm you have either omitted some materialcircumstances or minced or changed them in such a manner that i dohardly know my own work  when i formerly hinted to you something of thisin a letter you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of givingoffence that people in power were very watchful over the press and aptnot only to interpret but to punish every thing which looked like aninnuendo as i think you call it  but pray how could that which ispoke so many years ago and at about five thousand leagues distance inanother reign be applied to any of the yahoos who now are said togovern the herd especially at a time when i little thought or fearedthe unhappiness of living under them  have not i the most reason tocomplain when i see these very yahoos carried by houyhnhnms in avehicle as if they were brutes and those the rational creatures  andindeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principalmotive of my retirement hitherthus much i thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself and tothe trust i reposed in youi do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgment inbeing prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you andsome others very much against my own opinion to suffer my travels to bepublished  pray bring to your mind how often i desired you to considerwhen you insisted on the motive of public good that the yahoos were aspecies of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or exampleand so it has proved for instead of seeing a full stop put to allabuses and corruptions at least in this little island as i had reasonto expect behold after above six months warning i cannot learn that mybook has produced one single effect according to my intentions  idesired you would let me know by a letter when party and faction wereextinguished judges learned and upright pleaders honest and modestwith some tincture of common sense and smithfield blazing with pyramidsof law books the young nobilitys education entirely changed thephysicians banished the female yahoos abounding in virtue honourtruth and good sense courts and levees of great ministers thoroughlyweeded and swept wit merit and learning rewarded all disgracers ofthe press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their owncotton and quench their thirst with their own ink  these and athousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragementas indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in mybook  and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time tocorrect every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if theirnatures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdomyet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of yourletters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week withlibels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts whereini see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk of degradinghuman nature for so they have still the confidence to style it and ofabusing the female sex  i find likewise that the writers of thosebundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allowme to be the author of my own travels and others make me author of booksto which i am wholly a strangeri find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound thetimes and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neitherassigning the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and ihear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of mybook neither have i any copy left however i have sent you somecorrections which you may insert if ever there should be a secondedition and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leave that matter tomy judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they pleasei hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sealanguage as notproper in many parts nor now in use  i cannot help it  in my firstvoyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners andlearned to speak as they did  but i have since found that the seayahoos are apt like the land ones to become newfangled in theirwords which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember uponeach return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that icould hardly understand the new  and i observe when any yahoo comesfrom london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of usare able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to theotherif the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should havegreat reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think mybook of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone sofar as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no moreexistence than the inhabitants of utopiaindeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingragfor so the word should have been spelt and not erroneouslybrobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo sopresumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have relatedconcerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader withconviction  and is there less probability in my account of thehouyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there areso many thousands even in this country who only differ from theirbrother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber anddo not go naked  i wrote for their amendment and not their approbationthe united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to methan the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in mystable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve insome virtues without any mixture of vicedo these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated asto defend my veracity  yahoo as i am it is well known through allhouyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustriousmaster i was able in the compass of two years although i confess withthe utmost difficulty to remove that infernal habit of lying shufflingdeceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all myspecies especially the europeansi have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion but iforbear troubling myself or you any further  i must freely confess thatsince my last return some corruptions of my yahoo nature have revivedin me by conversing with a few of your species and particularly those ofmy own family by an unavoidable necessity else i should never haveattempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the yahoo race inthis kingdom but i have now done with all such visionary schemes foreverapril  part i  a voyage to lilliputchapter ithe author gives some account of himself and family  his firstinducements to travel  he is shipwrecked and swims for his life  getssafe on shore in the country of lilliput is made a prisoner and carriedup the countrymy father had a small estate in nottinghamshire i was the third of fivesons  he sent me to emanuel college in cambridge at fourteen years oldwhere i resided three years and applied myself close to my studies butthe charge of maintaining me although i had a very scanty allowancebeing too great for a narrow fortune i was bound apprentice to mr jamesbates an eminent surgeon in london with whom i continued four yearsmy father now and then sending me small sums of money i laid them out inlearning navigation and other parts of the mathematics useful to thosewho intend to travel as i always believed it would be some time orother my fortune to do  when i left mr bates i went down to myfather where by the assistance of him and my uncle john and some otherrelations i got forty pounds and a promise of thirty pounds a year tomaintain me at leyden there i studied physic two years and seven monthsknowing it would be useful in long voyagessoon after my return from leyden i was recommended by my good mastermr bates to be surgeon to the swallow captain abraham pannelcommander with whom i continued three years and a half making a voyageor two into the levant and some other parts  when i came back iresolved to settle in london to which mr bates my master encouragedme and by him i was recommended to several patients  i took part of asmall house in the old jewry and being advised to alter my condition imarried mrs mary burton second daughter to mr edmund burton hosierin newgatestreet with whom i received four hundred pounds for aportionbut my good master bates dying in two years after and i having fewfriends my business began to fail for my conscience would not suffer meto imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren  havingtherefore consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintance idetermined to go again to sea  i was surgeon successively in two shipsand made several voyages for six years to the east and west indies bywhich i got some addition to my fortune  my hours of leisure i spent inreading the best authors ancient and modern being always provided witha good number of books and when i was ashore in observing the mannersand dispositions of the people as well as learning their languagewherein i had a great facility by the strength of my memorythe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate i grew weary of thesea and intended to stay at home with my wife and family  i removedfrom the old jewry to fetter lane and from thence to wapping hoping toget business among the sailors but it would not turn to account  afterthree years expectation that things would mend i accepted anadvantageous offer from captain william prichard master of the antelopewho was making a voyage to the south sea  we set sail from bristol may  and our voyage was at first very prosperousit would not be proper for some reasons to trouble the reader with theparticulars of our adventures in those seas let it suffice to informhim that in our passage from thence to the east indies we were drivenby a violent storm to the northwest of van diemens land  by anobservation we found ourselves in the latitude of  degrees  minutessouth  twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill foodthe rest were in a very weak condition  on the th of november whichwas the beginning of summer in those parts the weather being very hazythe seamen spied a rock within half a cables length of the ship but thewind was so strong that we were driven directly upon it and immediatelysplit  six of the crew of whom i was one having let down the boat intothe sea made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock  we rowedby my computation about three leagues till we were able to work nolonger being already spent with labour while we were in the ship  wetherefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves and in about halfan hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north  whatbecame of my companions in the boat as well as of those who escaped onthe rock or were left in the vessel i cannot tell but conclude theywere all lost  for my own part i swam as fortune directed me and waspushed forward by wind and tide  i often let my legs drop and couldfeel no bottom but when i was almost gone and able to struggle nolonger i found myself within my depth and by this time the storm wasmuch abated  the declivity was so small that i walked near a milebefore i got to the shore which i conjectured was about eight oclock inthe evening  i then advanced forward near half a mile but could notdiscover any sign of houses or inhabitants at least i was in so weak acondition that i did not observe them  i was extremely tired and withthat and the heat of the weather and about half a pint of brandy that idrank as i left the ship i found myself much inclined to sleep  i laydown on the grass which was very short and soft where i slept sounderthan ever i remembered to have done in my life and as i reckoned aboutnine hours for when i awaked it was just daylight  i attempted torise but was not able to stir for as i happened to lie on my back ifound my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the groundand my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner  ilikewise felt several slender ligatures across my body from my armpitsto my thighs  i could only look upwards the sun began to grow hot andthe light offended my eyes  i heard a confused noise about me but inthe posture i lay could see nothing except the sky  in a little time ifelt something alive moving on my left leg which advancing gentlyforward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bending my eyesdownwards as much as i could i perceived it to be a human creature notsix inches high with a bow and arrow in his hands and a quiver at hisback  in the mean time i felt at least forty more of the same kind asi conjectured following the first  i was in the utmost astonishmentand roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of themas i was afterwards told were hurt with the falls they got by leapingfrom my sides upon the ground  however they soon returned and one ofthem who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face lifting uphis hands and eyes by way of admiration cried out in a shrill butdistinct voice hekinah degul the others repeated the same wordsseveral times but then i knew not what they meant  i lay all thiswhile as the reader may believe in great uneasiness  at lengthstruggling to get loose i had the fortune to break the strings andwrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground for bylifting it up to my face i discovered the methods they had taken to bindme and at the same time with a violent pull which gave me excessivepain i a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the leftside so that i was just able to turn my head about two inches  but thecreatures ran off a second time before i could seize them whereuponthere was a great shout in a very shrill accent and after it ceased iheard one of them cry aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant i feltabove a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand which pricked me likeso many needles and besides they shot another flight into the air aswe do bombs in europe whereof many i suppose fell on my body thoughi felt them not and some on my face which i immediately covered withmy left hand  when this shower of arrows was over i fell a groaningwith grief and pain and then striving again to get loose theydischarged another volley larger than the first and some of themattempted with spears to stick me in the sides but by good luck i had ona buff jerkin which they could not pierce  i thought it the mostprudent method to lie still and my design was to continue so till nightwhen my left hand being already loose i could easily free myself andas for the inhabitants i had reason to believe i might be a match forthe greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of thesame size with him that i saw  but fortune disposed otherwise of mewhen the people observed i was quiet they discharged no more arrowsbut by the noise i heard i knew their numbers increased and about fouryards from me over against my right ear i heard a knocking for above anhour like that of people at work when turning my head that way as wellas the pegs and strings would permit me i saw a stage erected about afoot and a half from the ground capable of holding four of theinhabitants with two or three ladders to mount it from whence one ofthem who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speechwhereof i understood not one syllable  but i should have mentioned thatbefore the principal person began his oration he cried out three timeslangro dehul san these words and the former were afterwards repeatedand explained to me whereupon immediately about fifty of theinhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of myhead which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right and ofobserving the person and gesture of him that was to speak  he appearedto be of a middle age and taller than any of the other three whoattended him whereof one was a page that held up his train and seemedto be somewhat longer than my middle finger the other two stood one oneach side to support him  he acted every part of an orator and i couldobserve many periods of threatenings and others of promises pity andkindness  i answered in a few words but in the most submissive mannerlifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun as calling him fora witness and being almost famished with hunger having not eaten amorsel for some hours before i left the ship i found the demands ofnature so strong upon me that i could not forbear showing my impatienceperhaps against the strict rules of decency by putting my fingerfrequently to my mouth to signify that i wanted food  the hurgo forso they call a great lord as i afterwards learnt understood me verywell  he descended from the stage and commanded that several laddersshould be applied to my sides on which above a hundred of theinhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth laden with baskets fullof meat which had been provided and sent thither by the kings ordersupon the first intelligence he received of me  i observed there was theflesh of several animals but could not distinguish them by the tastethere were shoulders legs and loins shaped like those of mutton andvery well dressed but smaller than the wings of a lark  i ate them bytwo or three at a mouthful and took three loaves at a time about thebigness of musket bullets  they supplied me as fast as they couldshowing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk andappetite  i then made another sign that i wanted drink  they found bymy eating that a small quantity would not suffice me and being a mostingenious people they slung up with great dexterity one of theirlargest hogsheads then rolled it towards my hand and beat out the topi drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not holdhalf a pint and tasted like a small wine of burgundy but much moredelicious  they brought me a second hogshead which i drank in the samemanner and made signs for more but they had none to give me  when ihad performed these wonders they shouted for joy and danced upon mybreast repeating several times as they did at first hekinah degulthey made me a sign that i should throw down the two hogsheads but firstwarning the people below to stand out of the way crying aloud borachmevolah and when they saw the vessels in the air there was a universalshout of hekinah degul  i confess i was often tempted while they werepassing backwards and forwards on my body to seize forty or fifty of thefirst that came in my reach and dash them against the ground  but theremembrance of what i had felt which probably might not be the worstthey could do and the promise of honour i made themfor so i interpretedmy submissive behavioursoon drove out these imaginations  besides inow considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality to a peoplewho had treated me with so much expense and magnificence  however in mythoughts i could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of thesediminutive mortals who durst venture to mount and walk upon my bodywhile one of my hands was at liberty without trembling at the very sightof so prodigious a creature as i must appear to them  after some timewhen they observed that i made no more demands for meat there appearedbefore me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty  hisexcellency having mounted on the small of my right leg advancedforwards up to my face with about a dozen of his retinue and producinghis credentials under the signet royal which he applied close to myeyes spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger but with a kindof determinate resolution often pointing forwards which as iafterwards found was towards the capital city about half a miledistant whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that i must beconveyed  i answered in few words but to no purpose and made a signwith my hand that was loose putting it to the other but over hisexcellencys head for fear of hurting him or his train and then to myown head and body to signify that i desired my liberty  it appearedthat he understood me well enough for he shook his head by way ofdisapprobation and held his hand in a posture to show that i must becarried as a prisoner  however he made other signs to let me understandthat i should have meat and drink enough and very good treatmentwhereupon i once more thought of attempting to break my bonds but againwhen i felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands which wereall in blisters and many of the darts still sticking in them andobserving likewise that the number of my enemies increased i gave tokensto let them know that they might do with me what they pleased  uponthis the hurgo and his train withdrew with much civility and cheerfulcountenances  soon after i heard a general shout with frequentrepetitions of the words peplom selan and i felt great numbers ofpeople on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree that i wasable to turn upon my right and to ease myself with making water which ivery plentifully did to the great astonishment of the people whoconjecturing by my motion what i was going to do immediately opened tothe right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell withsuch noise and violence from me  but before this they had daubed myface and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to thesmell which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrowsthese circumstances added to the refreshment i had received by theirvictuals and drink which were very nourishing disposed me to sleep  islept about eight hours as i was afterwards assured and it was nowonder for the physicians by the emperors order had mingled a sleepypotion in the hogsheads of wineit seems that upon the first moment i was discovered sleeping on theground after my landing the emperor had early notice of it by anexpress and determined in council that i should be tied in the manner ihave related which was done in the night while i slept that plenty ofmeat and drink should be sent to me and a machine prepared to carry meto the capital citythis resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous and i amconfident would not be imitated by any prince in europe on the likeoccasion  however in my opinion it was extremely prudent as well asgenerous for supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me withtheir spears and arrows while i was asleep i should certainly haveawaked with the first sense of smart which might so far have roused myrage and strength as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith iwas tied after which as they were not able to make resistance so theycould expect no mercythese people are most excellent mathematicians and arrived to a greatperfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of theemperor who is a renowned patron of learning  this prince has severalmachines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other greatweights  he often builds his largest men of war whereof some are ninefeet long in the woods where the timber grows and has them carried onthese engines three or four hundred yards to the sea  five hundredcarpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare thegreatest engine they had  it was a frame of wood raised three inchesfrom the ground about seven feet long and four wide moving upontwentytwo wheels  the shout i heard was upon the arrival of thisengine which it seems set out in four hours after my landing  it wasbrought parallel to me as i lay  but the principal difficulty was toraise and place me in this vehicle  eighty poles each of one foot highwere erected for this purpose and very strong cords of the bigness ofpackthread were fastened by hooks to many bandages which the workmenhad girt round my neck my hands my body and my legs  nine hundred ofthe strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by many pulleysfastened on the poles and thus in less than three hours i was raisedand slung into the engine and there tied fast  all this i was toldfor while the operation was performing i lay in a profound sleep bythe force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor  fifteenhundred of the emperors largest horses each about four inches and ahalf high were employed to draw me towards the metropolis which as isaid was half a mile distantabout four hours after we began our journey i awaked by a veryridiculous accident for the carriage being stopped a while to adjustsomething that was out of order two or three of the young natives hadthe curiosity to see how i looked when i was asleep they climbed up intothe engine and advancing very softly to my face one of them an officerin the guards put the sharp end of his halfpike a good way up into myleft nostril which tickled my nose like a straw and made me sneezeviolently whereupon they stole off unperceived and it was three weeksbefore i knew the cause of my waking so suddenly  we made a long marchthe remaining part of the day and rested at night with five hundredguards on each side of me half with torches and half with bows andarrows ready to shoot me if i should offer to stir  the next morning atsunrise we continued our march and arrived within two hundred yards ofthe city gates about noon  the emperor and all his court came out tomeet us but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty toendanger his person by mounting on my bodyat the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient templeesteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom which having beenpolluted some years before by an unnatural murder was according to thezeal of those people looked upon as profane and therefore had beenapplied to common use and all the ornaments and furniture carried awayin this edifice it was determined i should lodge  the great gatefronting to the north was about four feet high and almost two feet widethrough which i could easily creep  on each side of the gate was a smallwindow not above six inches from the ground into that on the left sidethe kings smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains like those thathang to a ladys watch in europe and almost as large which were lockedto my left leg with sixandthirty padlocks  over against this templeon the other side of the great highway at twenty feet distance therewas a turret at least five feet high  here the emperor ascended withmany principal lords of his court to have an opportunity of viewing meas i was told for i could not see them  it was reckoned that above ahundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errandand in spite of my guards i believe there could not be fewer than tenthousand at several times who mounted my body by the help of laddersbut a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain of deathwhen the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cutall the strings that bound me whereupon i rose up with as melancholy adisposition as ever i had in my life  but the noise and astonishment ofthe people at seeing me rise and walk are not to be expressed  thechains that held my left leg were about two yards long and gave me notonly the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle butbeing fixed within four inches of the gate allowed me to creep in andlie at my full length in the templechapter iithe emperor of lilliput attended by several of the nobility comes tosee the author in his confinement  the emperors person and habitdescribed  learned men appointed to teach the author their language  hegains favour by his mild disposition  his pockets are searched and hissword and pistols taken from himwhen i found myself on my feet i looked about me and must confess inever beheld a more entertaining prospect  the country around appearedlike a continued garden and the enclosed fields which were generallyforty feet square resembled so many beds of flowers  these fields wereintermingled with woods of half a stang  and the tallest trees asi could judge appeared to be seven feet high  i viewed the town on myleft hand which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatrei had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of naturewhich was no wonder it being almost two days since i had lastdisburdened myself  i was under great difficulties between urgency andshame  the best expedient i could think of was to creep into my housewhich i accordingly did and shutting the gate after me i went as far asthe length of my chain would suffer and discharged my body of thatuneasy load  but this was the only time i was ever guilty of souncleanly an action for which i cannot but hope the candid reader willgive some allowance after he has maturely and impartially considered mycase and the distress i was in  from this time my constant practicewas as soon as i rose to perform that business in open air at the fullextent of my chain and due care was taken every morning before companycame that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheelbarrowsby two servants appointed for that purpose  i would not have dwelt solong upon a circumstance that perhaps at first sight may appear notvery momentous if i had not thought it necessary to justify mycharacter in point of cleanliness to the world which i am told someof my maligners have been pleased upon this and other occasions to callin questionwhen this adventure was at an end i came back out of my house havingoccasion for fresh air  the emperor was already descended from thetower and advancing on horseback towards me which had like to have costhim dear for the beast though very well trained yet wholly unused tosuch a sight which appeared as if a mountain moved before him reared upon its hinder feet but that prince who is an excellent horseman kepthis seat till his attendants ran in and held the bridle while hismajesty had time to dismount  when he alighted he surveyed me roundwith great admiration but kept beyond the length of my chain  heordered his cooks and butlers who were already prepared to give mevictuals and drink which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles uponwheels till i could reach them  i took these vehicles and soon emptiedthem all twenty of them were filled with meat and ten with liquor eachof the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls and i emptied theliquor of ten vessels which was contained in earthen vials into onevehicle drinking it off at a draught and so i did with the rest  theempress and young princes of the blood of both sexes attended by manyladies sat at some distance in their chairs but upon the accident thathappened to the emperors horse they alighted and came near his personwhich i am now going to describe  he is taller by almost the breadth ofmy nail than any of his court which alone is enough to strike an aweinto the beholders  his features are strong and masculine with anaustrian lip and arched nose his complexion olive his countenanceerect his body and limbs well proportioned all his motions gracefuland his deportment majestic  he was then past his prime beingtwentyeight years and three quarters old of which he had reigned aboutseven in great felicity and generally victorious  for the betterconvenience of beholding him i lay on my side so that my face wasparallel to his and he stood but three yards off however i have hadhim since many times in my hand and therefore cannot be deceived in thedescription  his dress was very plain and simple and the fashion of itbetween the asiatic and the european but he had on his head a lighthelmet of gold adorned with jewels and a plume on the crest  he heldhis sword drawn in his hand to defend himself if i should happen tobreak loose it was almost three inches long the hilt and scabbard weregold enriched with diamonds  his voice was shrill but very clear andarticulate and i could distinctly hear it when i stood up  the ladiesand courtiers were all most magnificently clad so that the spot theystood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the groundembroidered with figures of gold and silver  his imperial majesty spokeoften to me and i returned answers but neither of us could understand asyllable  there were several of his priests and lawyers present as iconjectured by their habits who were commanded to address themselves tome and i spoke to them in as many languages as i had the leastsmattering of which were high and low dutch latin french spanishitalian and lingua franca but all to no purpose  after about two hoursthe court retired and i was left with a strong guard to prevent theimpertinence and probably the malice of the rabble who were veryimpatient to crowd about me as near as they durst and some of them hadthe impudence to shoot their arrows at me as i sat on the ground by thedoor of my house whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye  but thecolonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized and thought nopunishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands which someof his soldiers accordingly did pushing them forward with the buttendsof their pikes into my reach  i took them all in my right hand put fiveof them into my coatpocket and as to the sixth i made a countenance asif i would eat him alive  the poor man squalled terribly and thecolonel and his officers were in much pain especially when they saw metake out my penknife but i soon put them out of fear for lookingmildly and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with i set himgently on the ground and away he ran  i treated the rest in the samemanner taking them one by one out of my pocket and i observed both thesoldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemencywhich was represented very much to my advantage at courttowards night i got with some difficulty into my house where i lay onthe ground and continued to do so about a fortnight during which timethe emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me  six hundred bedsof the common measure were brought in carriages and worked up in myhouse a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn together made up thebreadth and length and these were four double which however kept mebut very indifferently from the hardness of the floor that was of smoothstone  by the same computation they provided me with sheets blanketsand coverlets tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured tohardshipsas the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom it broughtprodigious numbers of rich idle and curious people to see me so thatthe villages were almost emptied and great neglect of tillage andhousehold affairs must have ensued if his imperial majesty had notprovided by several proclamations and orders of state against thisinconveniency  he directed that those who had already beheld me shouldreturn home and not presume to come within fifty yards of my housewithout license from the court whereby the secretaries of state gotconsiderable feesin the mean time the emperor held frequent councils to debate whatcourse should be taken with me and i was afterwards assured by aparticular friend a person of great quality who was as much in thesecret as any that the court was under many difficulties concerning methey apprehended my breaking loose that my diet would be very expensiveand might cause a famine  sometimes they determined to starve me or atleast to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows which wouldsoon despatch me but again they considered that the stench of so largea carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis and probably spreadthrough the whole kingdom  in the midst of these consultations severalofficers of the army went to the door of the great councilchamber andtwo of them being admitted gave an account of my behaviour to the sixcriminals abovementioned which made so favourable an impression in thebreast of his majesty and the whole board in my behalf that an imperialcommission was issued out obliging all the villages nine hundred yardsround the city to deliver in every morning six beeves forty sheep andother victuals for my sustenance together with a proportionable quantityof bread and wine and other liquors for the due payment of which hismajesty gave assignments upon his treasuryfor this prince lives chieflyupon his own demesnes seldom except upon great occasions raising anysubsidies upon his subjects who are bound to attend him in his wars attheir own expense  an establishment was also made of six hundred personsto be my domestics who had boardwages allowed for their maintenanceand tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door  itwas likewise ordered that three hundred tailors should make me a suit ofclothes after the fashion of the country that six of his majestysgreatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their languageand lastly that the emperors horses and those of the nobility andtroops of guards should be frequently exercised in my sight to accustomthemselves to me  all these orders were duly put in execution and inabout three weeks i made a great progress in learning their languageduring which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits andwas pleased to assist my masters in teaching me  we began already toconverse together in some sort and the first words i learnt were toexpress my desire that he would please give me my liberty which ievery day repeated on my knees  his answer as i could comprehend itwas that this must be a work of time not to be thought on without theadvice of his council and that first i must lumos kelmin pesso desmarlon emposo that is swear a peace with him and his kingdom  howeverthat i should be used with all kindness  and he advised me to acquireby my patience and discreet behaviour the good opinion of himself andhis subjects  he desired i would not take it ill if he gave orders tocertain proper officers to search me for probably i might carry about meseveral weapons which must needs be dangerous things if they answeredthe bulk of so prodigious a person  i said his majesty should besatisfied for i was ready to strip myself and turn up my pockets beforehim  this i delivered part in words and part in signs  he repliedthat by the laws of the kingdom i must be searched by two of hisofficers that he knew this could not be done without my consent andassistance and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justiceas to trust their persons in my hands that whatever they took from meshould be returned when i left the country or paid for at the rate whichi would set upon them  i took up the two officers in my hands put themfirst into my coatpockets and then into every other pocket about meexcept my two fobs and another secret pocket which i had no mind shouldbe searched wherein i had some little necessaries that were of noconsequence to any but myself  in one of my fobs there was a silverwatch and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse  thesegentlemen having pen ink and paper about them made an exactinventory of every thing they saw and when they had done desired iwould set them down that they might deliver it to the emperor  thisinventory i afterwards translated into english and is word for word asfollows    imprimis in the right coatpocket of the great manmountain for    so i interpret the words quinbus flestrin after the strictest    search we found only one great piece of coarsecloth large enough    to be a footcloth for your majestys chief room of state  in the    left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a cover of the same    metal which we the searchers were not able to lift  we desired it    should be opened and one of us stepping into it found himself up to    the mid leg in a sort of dust some part whereof flying up to our    faces set us both a sneezing for several times together  in his    right waistcoatpocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin    substances folded one over another about the bigness of three men    tied with a strong cable and marked with black figures which we    humbly conceive to be writings every letter almost half as large as    the palm of our hands  in the left there was a sort of engine from    the back of which were extended twenty long poles resembling the    pallisados before your majestys court wherewith we conjecture the    manmountain combs his head for we did not always trouble him with    questions because we found it a great difficulty to make him    understand us  in the large pocket on the right side of his middle    cover so i translate the word ranfulo by which they meant my    breeches we saw a hollow pillar of iron about the length of a    man fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar and    upon one side of the pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out    cut into strange figures which we know not what to make of  in the    left pocket another engine of the same kind  in the smaller pocket    on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red    metal of different bulk some of the white which seemed to be    silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and i could hardly    lift them  in the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly    shaped we could not without difficulty reach the top of them as    we stood at the bottom of his pocket  one of them was covered and    seemed all of a piece but at the upper end of the other there    appeared a white round substance about twice the bigness of our    heads  within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of    steel which by our orders we obliged him to show us because we    apprehended they might be dangerous engines  he took them out of    their cases and told us that in his own country his practice was to    shave his beard with one of these and cut his meat with the other    there were two pockets which we could not enter these he called his    fobs they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover    but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly  out of the right    fob hung a great silver chain with a wonderful kind of engine at the    bottom  we directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that    chain which appeared to be a globe half silver and half of some    transparent metal for on the transparent side we saw certain    strange figures circularly drawn and thought we could touch them    till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance  he put    this engine into our ears which made an incessant noise like that    of a watermill and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal    or the god that he worships but we are more inclined to the latter    opinion because he assured us if we understood him right for he    expressed himself very imperfectly that he seldom did any thing    without consulting it  he called it his oracle and said it pointed    out the time for every action of his life  from the left fob he took    out a net almost large enough for a fisherman but contrived to open    and shut like a purse and served him for the same use we found    therein several massy pieces of yellow metal which if they be real    gold must be of immense value    having thus in obedience to your majestys commands diligently    searched all his pockets we observed a girdle about his waist made    of the hide of some prodigious animal from which on the left side    hung a sword of the length of five men and on the right a bag or    pouch divided into two cells each cell capable of holding three of    your majestys subjects  in one of these cells were several globes    or balls of a most ponderous metal about the bigness of our heads    and requiring a strong hand to lift them the other cell contained a    heap of certain black grains but of no great bulk or weight for we    could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands    this is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the    manmountain who used us with great civility and due respect to    your majestys commission  signed and sealed on the fourth day of    the eightyninth moon of your majestys auspicious reign                                          clefrin frelock marsi frelockwhen this inventory was read over to the emperor he directed mealthough in very gentle terms to deliver up the several particulars  hefirst called for my scimitar which i took out scabbard and all  in themean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops who thenattended him to surround me at a distance with their bows and arrowsjust ready to discharge but i did not observe it for mine eyes werewholly fixed upon his majesty  he then desired me to draw my scimitarwhich although it had got some rust by the sea water was in mostparts exceeding bright  i did so and immediately all the troops gave ashout between terror and surprise for the sun shone clear and thereflection dazzled their eyes as i waved the scimitar to and fro in myhand  his majesty who is a most magnanimous prince was less dauntedthan i could expect he ordered me to return it into the scabbard andcast it on the ground as gently as i could about six feet from the endof my chain  the next thing he demanded was one of the hollow ironpillars by which he meant my pocket pistols  i drew it out and at hisdesire as well as i could expressed to him the use of it and chargingit only with powder which by the closeness of my pouch happened toescape wetting in the sea an inconvenience against which all prudentmariners take special care to provide i first cautioned the emperor notto be afraid and then i let it off in the air  the astonishment herewas much greater than at the sight of my scimitar  hundreds fell down asif they had been struck dead and even the emperor although he stood hisground could not recover himself for some time  i delivered up both mypistols in the same manner as i had done my scimitar and then my pouchof powder and bullets begging him that the former might be kept fromfire for it would kindle with the smallest spark and blow up hisimperial palace into the air  i likewise delivered up my watch whichthe emperor was very curious to see and commanded two of his tallestyeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders asdraymen in england do a barrel of ale  he was amazed at the continualnoise it made and the motion of the minutehand which he could easilydiscern for their sight is much more acute than ours he asked theopinions of his learned men about it which were various and remote asthe reader may well imagine without my repeating although indeed i couldnot very perfectly understand them  i then gave up my silver and coppermoney my purse with nine large pieces of gold and some smaller onesmy knife and razor my comb and silver snuffbox my handkerchief andjournalbook  my scimitar pistols and pouch were conveyed incarriages to his majestys stores but the rest of my goods were returnedmei had as i before observed one private pocket which escaped theirsearch wherein there was a pair of spectacles which i sometimes use forthe weakness of mine eyes a pocket perspective and some other littleconveniences which being of no consequence to the emperor i did notthink myself bound in honour to discover and i apprehended they might belost or spoiled if i ventured them out of my possessionchapter iiithe author diverts the emperor and his nobility of both sexes in a veryuncommon manner  the diversions of the court of lilliput described  theauthor has his liberty granted him upon certain conditionsmy gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and hiscourt and indeed upon the army and people in general that i began toconceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time  i took allpossible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition  the nativescame by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me  i wouldsometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand and atlast the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hideandseekin my hair  i had now made a good progress in understanding and speakingthe language  the emperor had a mind one day to entertain me withseveral of the country shows wherein they exceed all nations i haveknown both for dexterity and magnificence  i was diverted with none somuch as that of the ropedancers performed upon a slender white threadextended about two feet and twelve inches from the ground  upon which ishall desire liberty with the readers patience to enlarge a littlethis diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates forgreat employments and high favour at court  they are trained in thisart from their youth and are not always of noble birth or liberaleducation  when a great office is vacant either by death or disgracewhich often happens five or six of those candidates petition theemperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the ropeand whoever jumps the highest without falling succeeds in the officevery often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show theirskill and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their facultyflimnap the treasurer is allowed to cut a caper on the straight ropeat least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire  i haveseen him do the summerset several times together upon a trencher fixedon a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in england  myfriend reldresal principal secretary for private affairs is in myopinion if i am not partial the second after the treasurer the rest ofthe great officers are much upon a parthese diversions are often attended with fatal accidents whereof greatnumbers are on record  i myself have seen two or three candidates breaka limb  but the danger is much greater when the ministers themselvesare commanded to show their dexterity for by contending to excelthemselves and their fellows they strain so far that there is hardly oneof them who has not received a fall and some of them two or three  iwas assured that a year or two before my arrival flimnap wouldinfallibly have broke his neck if one of the kings cushions thataccidentally lay on the ground had not weakened the force of his fallthere is likewise another diversion which is only shown before theemperor and empress and first minister upon particular occasions  theemperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches longone is blue the other red and the third green  these threads areproposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind todistinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour  the ceremony is performedin his majestys great chamber of state where the candidates are toundergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former and such asi have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of thenew or old world  the emperor holds a stick in his hands both endsparallel to the horizon while the candidates advancing one by onesometimes leap over the stick sometimes creep under it backward andforward several times according as the stick is advanced or depressedsometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick and his first ministerthe other sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself  whoeverperforms his part with most agility and holds out the longest in leapingand creeping is rewarded with the bluecoloured silk the red is givento the next and the green to the third which they all wear girt twiceround about the middle and you see few great persons about this courtwho are not adorned with one of these girdlesthe horses of the army and those of the royal stables having been dailyled before me were no longer shy but would come up to my very feetwithout starting  the riders would leap them over my hand as i held iton the ground and one of the emperors huntsmen upon a large coursertook my foot shoe and all which was indeed a prodigious leap  i hadthe good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinarymanner  i desired he would order several sticks of two feet high andthe thickness of an ordinary cane to be brought me whereupon hismajesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordinglyand the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages drawn byeight horses to each  i took nine of these sticks and fixing themfirmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure two feet and a halfsquare i took four other sticks and tied them parallel at each cornerabout two feet from the ground then i fastened my handkerchief to thenine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it wastight as the top of a drum and the four parallel sticks rising aboutfive inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each sidewhen i had finished my work i desired the emperor to let a troop of hisbest horses twentyfour in number come and exercise upon this plainhis majesty approved of the proposal and i took them up one by one inmy hands ready mounted and armed with the proper officers to exercisethem  as soon as they got into order they divided into two partiesperformed mock skirmishes discharged blunt arrows drew their swordsfled and pursued attacked and retired and in short discovered the bestmilitary discipline i ever beheld  the parallel sticks secured them andtheir horses from falling over the stage and the emperor was so muchdelighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated severaldays and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of commandand with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let mehold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage when she wasable to take a full view of the whole performance  it was my goodfortune that no ill accident happened in these entertainments only oncea fiery horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with hishoof struck a hole in my handkerchief and his foot slipping heoverthrew his rider and himself but i immediately relieved them bothand covering the hole with one hand i set down the troop with the otherin the same manner as i took them up the horse that fell was strained inthe left shoulder but the rider got no hurt and i repaired myhandkerchief as well as i could however i would not trust to thestrength of it any more in such dangerous enterprisesabout two or three days before i was set at liberty as i wasentertaining the court with this kind of feat there arrived an expressto inform his majesty that some of his subjects riding near the placewhere i was first taken up had seen a great black substance lying on thearound very oddly shaped extending its edges round as wide as hismajestys bedchamber and rising up in the middle as high as a man thatit was no living creature as they at first apprehended for it lay onthe grass without motion and some of them had walked round it severaltimes that by mounting upon each others shoulders they had got to thetop which was flat and even and stamping upon it they found that itwas hollow within that they humbly conceived it might be somethingbelonging to the manmountain and if his majesty pleased they wouldundertake to bring it with only five horses  i presently knew what theymeant and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence  it seemsupon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck i was in suchconfusion that before i came to the place where i went to sleep my hatwhich i had fastened with a string to my head while i was rowing and hadstuck on all the time i was swimming fell off after i came to land thestring as i conjecture breaking by some accident which i neverobserved but thought my hat had been lost at sea  i entreated hisimperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon aspossible describing to him the use and the nature of it and the nextday the waggoners arrived with it but not in a very good condition theyhad bored two holes in the brim within an inch and half of the edge andfastened two hooks in the holes these hooks were tied by a long cord tothe harness and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an englishmile but the ground in that country being extremely smooth and levelit received less damage than i expectedtwo days after this adventure the emperor having ordered that part ofhis army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in readinesstook a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner  he desiredi would stand like a colossus with my legs as far asunder as iconveniently could  he then commanded his general who was an oldexperienced leader and a great patron of mine to draw up the troops inclose order and march them under me the foot by twentyfour abreastand the horse by sixteen with drums beating colours flying and pikesadvanced  this body consisted of three thousand foot and a thousandhorse  his majesty gave orders upon pain of death that every soldierin his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to myperson which however could not prevent some of the younger officers fromturning up their eyes as they passed under me and to confess the truthmy breeches were at that time in so ill a condition that they affordedsome opportunities for laughter and admirationi had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty that hismajesty at length mentioned the matter first in the cabinet and then ina full council where it was opposed by none except skyresh bolgolamwho was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy  but itwas carried against him by the whole board and confirmed by the emperorthat minister was galbet or admiral of the realm very much in hismasters confidence and a person well versed in affairs but of a moroseand sour complexion  however he was at length persuaded to comply butprevailed that the articles and conditions upon which i should be setfree and to which i must swear should be drawn up by himself  thesearticles were brought to me by skyresh bolgolam in person attended by twoundersecretaries and several persons of distinction  after they wereread i was demanded to swear to the performance of them first in themanner of my own country and afterwards in the method prescribed bytheir laws which was to hold my right foot in my left hand and toplace the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head and mythumb on the tip of my right ear  but because the reader may be curiousto have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to

emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity ofmeat and drink sufficient for the support of  lilliputians  sometime after asking a friend at court how they came to fix on thatdeterminate number he told me that his majestys mathematicians havingtaken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant and finding it toexceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one they concluded from thesimilarity of their bodies that mine must contain at least  oftheirs and consequently would require as much food as was necessary tosupport that number of lilliputians  by which the reader may conceive anidea of the ingenuity of that people as well as the prudent and exacteconomy of so great a princechapter ivmildendo the metropolis of lilliput described together with theemperors palace  a conversation between the author and a principalsecretary concerning the affairs of that empire  the authors offers toserve the emperor in his warsthe first request i made after i had obtained my liberty was that imight have license to see mildendo the metropolis which the emperoreasily granted me but with a special charge to do no hurt either to theinhabitants or their houses  the people had notice by proclamation ofmy design to visit the town  the wall which encompassed it is two feetand a half high and at least eleven inches broad so that a coach andhorses may be driven very safely round it and it is flanked with strongtowers at ten feet distance  i stepped over the great western gate andpassed very gently and sidling through the two principal streets onlyin my short waistcoat for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of thehouses with the skirts of my coat  i walked with the utmostcircumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain inthe streets although the orders were very strict that all people shouldkeep in their houses at their own peril  the garret windows and tops ofhouses were so crowded with spectators that i thought in all my travelsi had not seen a more populous place  the city is an exact square eachside of the wall being five hundred feet long  the two great streetswhich run across and divide it into four quarters are five feet widethe lanes and alleys which i could not enter but only view them as ipassed are from twelve to eighteen inches  the town is capable ofholding five hundred thousand souls the houses are from three to fivestories the shops and markets well providedthe emperors palace is in the centre of the city where the two greatstreets meet  it is enclosed by a wall of two feet high and twenty feetdistance from the buildings  i had his majestys permission to step overthis wall and the space being so wide between that and the palace icould easily view it on every side  the outward court is a square offorty feet and includes two other courts in the inmost are the royalapartments which i was very desirous to see but found it extremelydifficult for the great gates from one square into another were buteighteen inches high and seven inches wide  now the buildings of theouter court were at least five feet high and it was impossible for me tostride over them without infinite damage to the pile though the wallswere strongly built of hewn stone and four inches thick  at the sametime the emperor had a great desire that i should see the magnificence ofhis palace but this i was not able to do till three days after which ispent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in theroyal park about a hundred yards distant from the city  of these treesi made two stools each about three feet high and strong enough to bearmy weight  the people having received notice a second time i went againthrough the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands  when icame to the side of the outer court i stood upon one stool and took theother in my hand this i lifted over the roof and gently set it down onthe space between the first and second court which was eight feet widei then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to theother and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick  by thiscontrivance i got into the inmost court and lying down upon my side iapplied my face to the windows of the middle stories which were leftopen on purpose and discovered the most splendid apartments that can beimagined  there i saw the empress and the young princes in theirseveral lodgings with their chief attendants about them  her imperialmajesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me and gave me out ofthe window her hand to kissbut i shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of thiskind because i reserve them for a greater work which is now almostready for the press containing a general description of this empirefrom its first erection through along series of princes with aparticular account of their wars and politics laws learning andreligion their plants and animals their peculiar manners and customswith other matters very curious and useful my chief design at presentbeing only to relate such events and transactions as happened to thepublic or to myself during a residence of about nine months in thatempireone morning about a fortnight after i had obtained my libertyreldresal principal secretary as they style him for private affairscame to my house attended only by one servant  he ordered his coach towait at a distance and desired i would give him an hours audience whichi readily consented to on account of his quality and personal merits aswell as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitationsat court  i offered to lie down that he might the more convenientlyreach my ear but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand duringour conversation  he began with compliments on my liberty said hemight pretend to some merit in it but however added that if it hadnot been for the present situation of things at court perhaps i mightnot have obtained it so soon  for said he as flourishing a conditionas we may appear to be in to foreigners we labour under two mightyevils a violent faction at home and the danger of an invasion by amost potent enemy from abroad  as to the first you are to understandthat for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling partiesin this empire under the names of tramecksan and slamecksan fromthe high and low heels of their shoes by which they distinguishthemselves  it is alleged indeed that the high heels are mostagreeable to our ancient constitution but however this be his majestyhas determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of thegovernment and all offices in the gift of the crown as you cannot butobserve and particularly that his majestys imperial heels are lower atleast by a drurr than any of his court drurr is a measure about thefourteenth part of an inch  the animosities between these two partiesrun so high that they will neither eat nor drink nor talk with eachother  we compute the tramecksan or high heels to exceed us innumber but the power is wholly on our side  we apprehend his imperialhighness the heir to the crown to have some tendency towards the highheels at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higherthan the other which gives him a hobble in his gait  now in the midstof these intestine disquiets we are threatened with an invasion from theisland of blefuscu which is the other great empire of the universealmost as large and powerful as this of his majesty  for as to what wehave heard you affirm that there are other kingdoms and states in theworld inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself our philosophersare in much doubt and would rather conjecture that you dropped from themoon or one of the stars because it is certain that a hundred mortalsof your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle ofhis majestys dominions besides our histories of six thousand moonsmake no mention of any other regions than the two great empires oflilliput and blefuscu  which two mighty powers have as i was going totell you been engaged in a most obstinate war for sixandthirty moonspast  it began upon the following occasion  it is allowed on all handsthat the primitive way of breaking eggs before we eat them was upon thelarger end but his present majestys grandfather while he was a boygoing to eat an egg and breaking it according to the ancient practicehappened to cut one of his fingers  whereupon the emperor his fatherpublished an edict commanding all his subjects upon great penalties tobreak the smaller end of their eggs  the people so highly resented thislaw that our histories tell us there have been six rebellions raised onthat account wherein one emperor lost his life and another his crownthese civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs ofblefuscu and when they were quelled the exiles always fled for refugeto that empire  it is computed that eleven thousand persons have atseveral times suffered death rather than submit to break their eggs atthe smaller end  many hundred large volumes have been published uponthis controversy but the books of the bigendians have been longforbidden and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holdingemployments  during the course of these troubles the emperors ofblefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors accusing us ofmaking a schism in religion by offending against a fundamental doctrineof our great prophet lustrog in the fiftyfourth chapter of theblundecral which is their alcoran  this however is thought to be amere strain upon the text for the words are these that all truebelievers break their eggs at the convenient end  and which is theconvenient end seems in my humble opinion to be left to every mansconscience or at least in the power of the chief magistrate todetermine  now the bigendian exiles have found so much credit in theemperor of blefuscus court and so much private assistance andencouragement from their party here at home that a bloody war has beencarried on between the two empires for sixandthirty moons with varioussuccess during which time we have lost forty capital ships and a much agreater number of smaller vessels together with thirty thousand of ourbest seamen and soldiers and the damage received by the enemy isreckoned to be somewhat greater than ours  however they have nowequipped a numerous fleet and are just preparing to make a descent uponus and his imperial majesty placing great confidence in your valour andstrength has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs beforeyoui desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor and tolet him know that i thought it would not become me who was aforeigner to interfere with parties but i was ready with the hazard ofmy life to defend his person and state against all invaderschapter vthe author by an extraordinary stratagem prevents an invasion  a hightitle of honour is conferred upon him  ambassadors arrive from theemperor of blefuscu and sue for peace  the empresss apartment on fireby an accident the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palacethe empire of blefuscu is an island situated to the northeast oflilliput from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundredyards wide  i had not yet seen it and upon this notice of an intendedinvasion i avoided appearing on that side of the coast for fear ofbeing discovered by some of the enemys ships who had received nointelligence of me all intercourse between the two empires having beenstrictly forbidden during the war upon pain of death and an embargolaid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever  i communicated to hismajesty a project i had formed of seizing the enemys whole fleet whichas our scouts assured us lay at anchor in the harbour ready to sailwith the first fair wind  i consulted the most experienced seamen uponthe depth of the channel which they had often plumbed who told me thatin the middle at highwater it was seventy glumgluffs deep which isabout six feet of european measure and the rest of it fifty glumgluffsat most  i walked towards the northeast coast over against blefuscuwhere lying down behind a hillock i took out my small perspectiveglass and viewed the enemys fleet at anchor consisting of about fiftymen of war and a great number of transports i then came back to myhouse and gave orders for which i had a warrant for a great quantityof the strongest cable and bars of iron  the cable was about as thick aspackthread and the bars of the length and size of a knittingneedle  itrebled the cable to make it stronger and for the same reason i twistedthree of the iron bars together bending the extremities into a hookhaving thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables i went back to thenortheast coast and putting off my coat shoes and stockings walkedinto the sea in my leathern jerkin about half an hour before highwater  i waded with what haste i could and swam in the middle aboutthirty yards till i felt ground  i arrived at the fleet in less thanhalf an hour  the enemy was so frightened when they saw me that theyleaped out of their ships and swam to shore where there could not befewer than thirty thousand souls  i then took my tackling andfastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each i tied all the cordstogether at the end  while i was thus employed the enemy dischargedseveral thousand arrows many of which stuck in my hands and face andbeside the excessive smart gave me much disturbance in my work  mygreatest apprehension was for mine eyes which i should have infalliblylost if i had not suddenly thought of an expedient  i kept among otherlittle necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket which as iobserved before had escaped the emperors searchers  these i took outand fastened as strongly as i could upon my nose and thus armed went onboldly with my work in spite of the enemys arrows many of which struckagainst the glasses of my spectacles but without any other effectfurther than a little to discompose them  i had now fastened all thehooks and taking the knot in my hand began to pull but not a shipwould stir for they were all too fast held by their anchors so that theboldest part of my enterprise remained  i therefore let go the cord andleaving the looks fixed to the ships i resolutely cut with my knife thecables that fastened the anchors receiving about two hundred shots in myface and hands then i took up the knotted end of the cables to which myhooks were tied and with great ease drew fifty of the enemys largestmen of war after methe blefuscudians who had not the least imagination of what i intendedwere at first confounded with astonishment  they had seen me cut thecables and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift orfall foul on each other but when they perceived the whole fleet movingin order and saw me pulling at the end they set up such a scream ofgrief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceivewhen i had got out of danger i stopped awhile to pick out the arrowsthat stuck in my hands and face and rubbed on some of the same ointmentthat was given me at my first arrival as i have formerly mentioned  ithen took off my spectacles and waiting about an hour till the tide wasa little fallen i waded through the middle with my cargo and arrivedsafe at the royal port of lilliputthe emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the issueof this great adventure  they saw the ships move forward in a largehalfmoon but could not discern me who was up to my breast in waterwhen i advanced to the middle of the channel they were yet more in painbecause i was under water to my neck  the emperor concluded me to bedrowned and that the enemys fleet was approaching in a hostile mannerbut he was soon eased of his fears for the channel growing shallowerevery step i made i came in a short time within hearing and holding upthe end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened i cried in a loudvoice long live the most puissant king of lilliput  this great princereceived me at my landing with all possible encomiums and created me anardac upon the spot which is the highest title of honour among themhis majesty desired i would take some other opportunity of bringing allthe rest of his enemys ships into his ports  and so unmeasureable isthe ambition of princes that he seemed to think of nothing less thanreducing the whole empire of blefuscu into a province and governing itby a viceroy of destroying the bigendian exiles and compelling thatpeople to break the smaller end of their eggs by which he would remainthe sole monarch of the whole world  but i endeavoured to divert himfrom this design by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy aswell as justice and i plainly protested that i would never be aninstrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery  and whenthe matter was debated in council the wisest part of the ministry wereof my opinionthis open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes andpolitics of his imperial majesty that he could never forgive me  hementioned it in a very artful manner at council where i was told thatsome of the wisest appeared at least by their silence to be of myopinion but others who were my secret enemies could not forbear someexpressions which by a sidewind reflected on me  and from this timebegan an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministersmaliciously bent against me which broke out in less than two months andhad like to have ended in my utter destruction  of so little weight arethe greatest services to princes when put into the balance with arefusal to gratify their passionsabout three weeks after this exploit there arrived a solemn embassy fromblefuscu with humble offers of a peace which was soon concluded uponconditions very advantageous to our emperor wherewith i shall nottrouble the reader  there were six ambassadors with a train of aboutfive hundred persons and their entry was very magnificent suitable tothe grandeur of their master and the importance of their business  whentheir treaty was finished wherein i did them several good offices by thecredit i now had or at least appeared to have at court theirexcellencies who were privately told how much i had been their friendmade me a visit in form  they began with many compliments upon my valourand generosity invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their mastersname and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strengthof which they had heard so many wonders wherein i readily obliged thembut shall not trouble the reader with the particularswhen i had for some time entertained their excellencies to theirinfinite satisfaction and surprise i desired they would do me the honourto present my most humble respects to the emperor their master therenown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world withadmiration and whose royal person i resolved to attend before ireturned to my own country  accordingly the next time i had the honourto see our emperor i desired his general license to wait on theblefuscudian monarch which he was pleased to grant me as i couldperceive in a very cold manner but could not guess the reason till ihad a whisper from a certain person that flimnap and bolgolam hadrepresented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark ofdisaffection from which i am sure my heart was wholly free  and thiswas the first time i began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts andministersit is to be observed that these ambassadors spoke to me by aninterpreter the languages of both empires differing as much from eachother as any two in europe and each nation priding itself upon theantiquity beauty and energy of their own tongue with an avowedcontempt for that of their neighbour yet our emperor standing upon theadvantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet obliged them todeliver their credentials and make their speech in the lilliputiantongue  and it must be confessed that from the great intercourse oftrade and commerce between both realms from the continual reception ofexiles which is mutual among them and from the custom in each empireto send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other in order topolish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men and mannersthere are few persons of distinction or merchants or seamen who dwellin the maritime parts but what can hold conversation in both tongues asi found some weeks after when i went to pay my respects to the emperorof blefuscu which in the midst of great misfortunes through the maliceof my enemies proved a very happy adventure to me as i shall relate inits proper placethe reader may remember that when i signed those articles upon which irecovered my liberty there were some which i disliked upon account oftheir being too servile neither could anything but an extreme necessityhave forced me to submit  but being now a nardac of the highest rankin that empire such offices were looked upon as below my dignity andthe emperor to do him justice never once mentioned them to mehowever it was not long before i had an opportunity of doing hismajesty at least as i then thought a most signal service  i wasalarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door bywhich being suddenly awaked i was in some kind of terror  i heard theword burglum repeated incessantly several of the emperors courtmaking their way through the crowd entreated me to come immediately tothe palace where her imperial majestys apartment was on fire by thecarelessness of a maid of honour who fell asleep while she was reading aromance  i got up in an instant and orders being given to clear the waybefore me and it being likewise a moonshine night i made a shift to getto the palace without trampling on any of the people  i found they hadalready applied ladders to the walls of the apartment and were wellprovided with buckets but the water was at some distance  these bucketswere about the size of large thimbles and the poor people supplied mewith them as fast as they could but the flame was so violent that theydid little good  i might easily have stifled it with my coat which iunfortunately left behind me for haste and came away only in my leathernjerkin  the case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable and thismagnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the groundif by a presence of mind unusual to me i had not suddenly thought of anexpedient  i had the evening before drunk plentifully of a mostdelicious wine called glimigrim the blefuscudians call it flunecbut ours is esteemed the better sort which is very diuretic  by theluckiest chance in the world i had not discharged myself of any part ofit  the heat i had contracted by coming very near the flames and bylabouring to quench them made the wine begin to operate by urine whichi voided in such a quantity and applied so well to the proper placesthat in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished and the rest ofthat noble pile which had cost so many ages in erecting preserved fromdestructionit was now daylight and i returned to my house without waiting tocongratulate with the emperor because although i had done a veryeminent piece of service yet i could not tell how his majesty mightresent the manner by which i had performed it for by the fundamentallaws of the realm it is capital in any person of what quality soeverto make water within the precincts of the palace  but i was a littlecomforted by a message from his majesty that he would give orders tothe grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form which however icould not obtain and i was privately assured that the empressconceiving the greatest abhorrence of what i had done removed to themost distant side of the court firmly resolved that those buildingsshould never be repaired for her use and in the presence of her chiefconfidents could not forbear vowing revengechapter viof the inhabitants of lilliput their learning laws and customs themanner of educating their children  the authors way of living in thatcountry  his vindication of a great ladyalthough i intend to leave the description of this empire to a particulartreatise yet in the mean time i am content to gratify the curiousreader with some general ideas  as the common size of the natives issomewhat under six inches high so there is an exact proportion in allother animals as well as plants and trees for instance the tallesthorses and oxen are between four and five inches in height the sheep aninch and half more or less their geese about the bigness of a sparrowand so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallestwhich to my sight were almost invisible but nature has adapted the eyesof the lilliputians to all objects proper for their view they see withgreat exactness but at no great distance  and to show the sharpness oftheir sight towards objects that are near i have been much pleased withobserving a cook pulling a lark which was not so large as a common flyand a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silktheir tallest trees are about seven feet high i mean some of those inthe great royal park the tops whereof i could but just reach with myfist clenched  the other vegetables are in the same proportion but thisi leave to the readers imaginationi shall say but little at present of their learning which for manyages has flourished in all its branches among them but their manner ofwriting is very peculiar being neither from the left to the right likethe europeans nor from the right to the left like the arabians norfrom up to down like the chinese but aslant from one corner of thepaper to the other like ladies in englandthey bury their dead with their heads directly downward because theyhold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to riseagain in which period the earth which they conceive to be flat willturn upside down and by this means they shall at their resurrection befound ready standing on their feet  the learned among them confess theabsurdity of this doctrine but the practice still continues incompliance to the vulgarthere are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar and if theywere not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country i shouldbe tempted to say a little in their justification  it is only to bewished they were as well executed  the first i shall mention relates toinformers  all crimes against the state are punished here with theutmost severity but if the person accused makes his innocence plainlyto appear upon his trial the accuser is immediately put to anignominious death and out of his goods or lands the innocent person isquadruply recompensed for the loss of his time for the danger heunderwent for the hardship of his imprisonment and for all the chargeshe has been at in making his defence or if that fund be deficient itis largely supplied by the crown  the emperor also confers on him somepublic mark of his favour and proclamation is made of his innocencethrough the whole citythey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft and therefore seldomfail to punish it with death for they allege that care and vigilancewith a very common understanding may preserve a mans goods fromthieves but honesty has no defence against superior cunning and sinceit is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buyingand selling and dealing upon credit where fraud is permitted andconnived at or has no law to punish it the honest dealer is alwaysundone and the knave gets the advantage  i remember when i was onceinterceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master ofa great sum of money which he had received by order and ran away withand happening to tell his majesty by way of extenuation that it wasonly a breach of trust the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offeras a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime and truly i hadlittle to say in return farther than the common answer that differentnations had different customs for i confess i was heartily ashamedalthough we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon whichall government turns yet i could never observe this maxim to be put inpractice by any nation except that of lilliput  whoever can there bringsufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his countryfor seventythree moons has a claim to certain privileges according tohis quality or condition of life with a proportionable sum of money outof a fund appropriated for that use he likewise acquires the title ofsnilpall or legal which is added to his name but does not descend tohis posterity  and these people thought it a prodigious defect of policyamong us when i told them that our laws were enforced only by penaltieswithout any mention of reward  it is upon this account that the image ofjustice in their courts of judicature is formed with six eyes twobefore as many behind and on each side one to signify circumspectionwith a bag of gold open in her right hand and a sword sheathed in herleft to show she is more disposed to reward than to punishin choosing persons for all employments they have more regard to goodmorals than to great abilities for since government is necessary tomankind they believe that the common size of human understanding isfitted to some station or other and that providence never intended tomake the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended onlyby a few persons of sublime genius of which there seldom are three bornin an age but they suppose truth justice temperance and the like tobe in every mans power the practice of which virtues assisted byexperience and a good intention would qualify any man for the service ofhis country except where a course of study is required  but theythought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied bysuperior endowments of the mind that employments could never be put intosuch dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified and at leastthat the mistakes committed by ignorance in a virtuous dispositionwould never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal as thepractices of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt and who hadgreat abilities to manage to multiply and defend his corruptionsin like manner the disbelief of a divine providence renders a manincapable of holding any public station for since kings avow themselvesto be the deputies of providence the lilliputians think nothing can bemore absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authorityunder which he actsin relating these and the following laws i would only be understood tomean the original institutions and not the most scandalous corruptionsinto which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man  foras to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing onthe ropes or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks andcreeping under them the reader is to observe that they were firstintroduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning and grew tothe present height by the gradual increase of party and factioningratitude is among them a capital crime as we read it to have been insome other countries for they reason thus that whoever makes illreturns to his benefactor must needs be a common enemy to the rest ofmankind from whom he has received no obligation and therefore such aman is not fit to livetheir notions relating to the duties of parents and children differextremely from ours  for since the conjunction of male and female isfounded upon the great law of nature in order to propagate and continuethe species the lilliputians will needs have it that men and women arejoined together like other animals by the motives of concupiscence andthat their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like naturalprinciple for which reason they will never allow that a child is underany obligation to his father for begetting him or to his mother forbringing him into the world which considering the miseries of humanlife was neither a benefit in itself nor intended so by his parentswhose thoughts in their love encounters were otherwise employed  uponthese and the like reasonings their opinion is that parents are thelast of all others to be trusted with the education of their ownchildren and therefore they have in every town public nurseries whereall parents except cottagers and labourers are obliged to send theirinfants of both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to theage of twenty moons at which time they are supposed to have somerudiments of docility  these schools are of several kinds suited todifferent qualities and both sexes  they have certain professors wellskilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits therank of their parents and their own capacities as well as inclinationsi shall first say something of the male nurseries and then of thefemalethe nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided withgrave and learned professors and their several deputies  the clothesand food of the children are plain and simple  they are bred up in theprinciples of honour justice courage modesty clemency religion andlove of their country they are always employed in some business exceptin the times of eating and sleeping which are very short and two hoursfor diversions consisting of bodily exercises  they are dressed by mentill four years of age and then are obliged to dress themselvesalthough their quality be ever so great and the women attendant who areaged proportionably to ours at fifty perform only the most menialoffices  they are never suffered to converse with servants but gotogether in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions andalways in the presence of a professor or one of his deputies wherebythey avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice to which ourchildren are subject  their parents are suffered to see them only twicea year the visit is to last but an hour they are allowed to kiss thechild at meeting and parting but a professor who always stands by onthose occasions will not suffer them to whisper or use any fondlingexpressions or bring any presents of toys sweetmeats and the likethe pension from each family for the education and entertainment of achild upon failure of due payment is levied by the emperors officersthe nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen merchants traders andhandicrafts are managed proportionably after the same manner only thosedesigned for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old whereasthose of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteenwhich answers to twentyone with us but the confinement is graduallylessened for the last three yearsin the female nurseries the young girls of quality are educated muchlike the males only they are dressed by orderly servants of their ownsex but always in the presence of a professor or deputy till they cometo dress themselves which is at five years old  and if it be found thatthese nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful orfoolish stories or the common follies practised by chambermaids amongus they are publicly whipped thrice about the city imprisoned for ayear and banished for life to the most desolate part of the countrythus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools asthe men and despise all personal ornaments beyond decency andcleanliness neither did i perceive any difference in their educationmade by their difference of sex only that the exercises of the femaleswere not altogether so robust and that some rules were given themrelating to domestic life and a smaller compass of learning was enjoinedthem for their maxim is that among peoples of quality a wife should bealways a reasonable and agreeable companion because she cannot always beyoung  when the girls are twelve years old which among them is themarriageable age their parents or guardians take them home with greatexpressions of gratitude to the professors and seldom without tears ofthe young lady and her companionsin the nurseries of females of the meaner sort the children areinstructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex and their severaldegrees those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years oldthe rest are kept to eleventhe meaner families who have children at these nurseries are obligedbesides their annual pension which is as low as possible to return tothe steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings to bea portion for the child and therefore all parents are limited in theirexpenses by the law  for the lilliputians think nothing can be moreunjust than for people in subservience to their own appetites to bringchildren into the world and leave the burthen of supporting them on thepublic  as to persons of quality they give security to appropriate acertain sum for each child suitable to their condition and these fundsare always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justicethe cottagers and labourers keep their children at home their businessbeing only to till and cultivate the earth and therefore their educationis of little consequence to the public but the old and diseased amongthem are supported by hospitals for begging is a trade unknown in thisempireand here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some accountof my domestics and my manner of living in this country during aresidence of nine months and thirteen days  having a head mechanicallyturned and being likewise forced by necessity i had made for myself atable and chair convenient enough out of the largest trees in the royalpark  two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts andlinen for my bed and table all of the strongest and coarsest kind theycould get which however they were forced to quilt together in severalfolds for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn  their linen isusually three inches wide and three feet make a piece  the sempstressestook my measure as i lay on the ground one standing at my neck andanother at my midleg with a strong cord extended that each held by theend while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inchlong  then they measured my right thumb and desired no more for by amathematical computation that twice round the thumb is once round thewrist and so on to the neck and the waist and by the help of my oldshirt which i displayed on the ground before them for a pattern theyfitted me exactly  three hundred tailors were employed in the samemanner to make me clothes but they had another contrivance for taking mymeasure  i kneeled down and they raised a ladder from the ground to myneck upon this ladder one of them mounted and let fall a plumblinefrom my collar to the floor which just answered the length of my coatbut my waist and arms i measured myself  when my clothes were finishedwhich was done in my house for the largest of theirs would not have beenable to hold them they looked like the patchwork made by the ladies inengland only that mine were all of a colouri had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals in little convenient hutsbuilt about my house where they and their families lived and preparedme two dishes apiece  i took up twenty waiters in my hand and placedthem on the table a hundred more attended below on the ground some withdishes of meat and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung ontheir shoulders all which the waiters above drew up as i wanted in avery ingenious manner by certain cords as we draw the bucket up a wellin europe  a dish of their meat was a good mouthful and a barrel oftheir liquor a reasonable draught  their mutton yields to ours buttheir beef is excellent  i have had a sirloin so large that i have beenforced to make three bites of it but this is rare  my servants wereastonished to see me eat it bones and all as in our country we do theleg of a lark  their geese and turkeys i usually ate at a mouthful andi confess they far exceed ours  of their smaller fowl i could take uptwenty or thirty at the end of my knifeone day his imperial majesty being informed of my way of living desiredthat himself and his royal consort with the young princes of the bloodof both sexes might have the happiness as he was pleased to call itof dining with me  they came accordingly and i placed them in chairsof state upon my table just over against me with their guards aboutthem  flimnap the lord high treasurer attended there likewise with hiswhite staff and i observed he often looked on me with a sourcountenance which i would not seem to regard but ate more than usualin honour to my dear country as well as to fill the court withadmiration  i have some private reasons to believe that this visit fromhis majesty gave flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to hismaster  that minister had always been my secret enemy though heoutwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of hisnature  he represented to the emperor the low condition of histreasury that he was forced to take up money at a great discount thatexchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent below par thati had cost his majesty above a million and a half of sprugs theirgreatest gold coin about the bigness of a spangle and upon the wholethat it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasionof dismissing mei am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady whowas an innocent sufferer upon my account  the treasurer took a fancy tobe jealous of his wife from the malice of some evil tongues whoinformed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my personand the court scandal ran for some time that she once came privately tomy lodging  this i solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehoodwithout any grounds further than that her grace was pleased to treat mewith all innocent marks of freedom and friendship  i own she came oftento my house but always publicly nor ever without three more in thecoach who were usually her sister and young daughter and someparticular acquaintance but this was common to many other ladies of thecourt  and i still appeal to my servants round whether they at any timesaw a coach at my door without knowing what persons were in it  onthose occasions when a servant had given me notice my custom was to goimmediately to the door and after paying my respects to take up thecoach and two horses very carefully in my hands for if there were sixhorses the postillion always unharnessed four and place them on atable where i had fixed a movable rim quite round of five inches highto prevent accidents  and i have often had four coaches and horses atonce on my table full of company while i sat in my chair leaning myface towards them and when i was engaged with one set the coachmenwould gently drive the others round my table  i have passed many anafternoon very agreeably in these conversations  but i defy thetreasurer or his two informers i will name them and let them make thebest of it clustril and drunlo to prove that any person ever came to meincognito except the secretary reldresal who was sent by expresscommand of his imperial majesty as i have before related  i should nothave dwelt so long upon this particular if it had not been a pointwherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned to saynothing of my own though i then had the honour to be a nardac whichthe treasurer himself is not for all the world knows that he is only aglumglum a title inferior by one degree as that of a marquis is to aduke in england yet i allow he preceded me in right of his post  thesefalse informations which i afterwards came to the knowledge of by anaccident not proper to mention made the treasurer show his lady for sometime an ill countenance and me a worse and although he was at lastundeceived and reconciled to her yet i lost all credit with him andfound my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself who wasindeed too much governed by that favouritechapter viithe author being informed of a design to accuse him of hightreasonmakes his escape to blefuscu  his reception therebefore i proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom it may beproper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for twomonths forming against mei had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts for which i wasunqualified by the meanness of my condition  i had indeed heard and readenough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers but neverexpected to have found such terrible effects of them in so remote acountry governed as i thought by very different maxims from those ineuropewhen i was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor ofblefuscu a considerable person at court to whom i had been veryserviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of hisimperial majesty came to my house very privately at night in a closechair and without sending his name desired admittance  the chairmenwere dismissed i put the chair with his lordship in it into mycoatpocket and giving orders to a trusty servant to say i wasindisposed and gone to sleep i fastened the door of my house placed thechair on the table according to my usual custom and sat down by itafter the common salutations were over observing his lordshipscountenance full of concern and inquiring into the reason he desired iwould hear him with patience in a matter that highly concerned my honourand my life  his speech was to the following effect for i took notesof it as soon as he left meyou are to know said he

   calin deffar plune it is enacted that whoever shall make water    within the precincts of the royal palace shall be liable to the    pains and penalties of hightreason notwithstanding the said    quinbus flestrin in open breach of the said law under colour of    extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majestys most    dear imperial consort did maliciously traitorously and devilishly    by discharge of his urine put out the said fire kindled in the said    apartment lying and being within the precincts of the said royal    palace against the statute in that case provided etc against the    duty etc    article ii    that the said quinbus flestrin having brought the imperial fleet    of blefuscu into the royal port and being afterwards commanded by    his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire    of blefuscu and reduce that empire to a province to be governed by    a viceroy from hence and to destroy and put to death not only all    the bigendian exiles but likewise all the people of that empire who    would not immediately forsake the bigendian heresy he the said    flestrin like a false traitor against his most auspicious serene    imperial majesty did petition to be excused from the said service    upon pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences or destroy    the liberties and lives of an innocent people    article iii    that whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the court of    blefuscu to sue for peace in his majestys court he the said    flestrin did like a false traitor aid abet comfort and divert    the said ambassadors although he knew them to be servants to a    prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty and in    an open war against his said majesty    article iv    that the said quinbus flestrin contrary to the duty of a faithful    subject is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of    blefuscu for which he has received only verbal license from his    imperial majesty and under colour of the said license does falsely    and traitorously intend to take the said voyage and thereby to aid    comfort and abet the emperor of blefuscu so lately an enemy and in    open war with his imperial majesty aforesaidthere are some other articles but these are the most important ofwhich i have read you an abstractin the several debates upon this impeachment it must be confessed thathis majesty gave many marks of his great lenity often urging theservices you had done him and endeavouring to extenuate your crimesthe treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the mostpainful and ignominious death by setting fire to your house at nightand the general was to attend with twenty thousand men armed withpoisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands  some of yourservants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on yourshirts and sheets which would soon make you tear your own flesh and diein the utmost torture  the general came into the same opinion so thatfor a long time there was a majority against you but his majestyresolving if possible to spare your life at last brought off thechamberlainupon this incident reldresal principal secretary for private affairswho always approved himself your true friend was commanded by theemperor to deliver his opinion which he accordingly did and thereinjustified the good thoughts you have of him  he allowed your crimes tobe great but that still there was room for mercy the most commendablevirtue in a prince and for which his majesty was so justly celebratedhe said the friendship between you and him was so well known to theworld that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partialhowever in obedience to the command he had received he would freelyoffer his sentiments  that if his majesty in consideration of yourservices and pursuant to his own merciful disposition would please tospare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes hehumbly conceived that by this expedient justice might in some measure besatisfied and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor aswell as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour tobe his counsellors  that the loss of your eyes would be no impediment toyour bodily strength by which you might still be useful to his majestythat blindness is an addition to courage by concealing dangers from usthat the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty inbringing over the enemys fleet and it would be sufficient for you tosee by the eyes of the ministers since the greatest princes do no morethis proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the wholeboard  bolgolam the admiral could not preserve his temper but risingup in fury said he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give hisopinion for preserving the life of a traitor that the services you hadperformed were by all true reasons of state the great aggravation ofyour crimes that you who were able to extinguish the fire by dischargeof urine in her majestys apartment which he mentioned with horrormight at another time raise an inundation by the same means to drownthe whole palace and the same strength which enabled you to bring overthe enemys fleet might serve upon the first discontent to carry itback that he had good reasons to think you were a bigendian in yourheart and as treason begins in the heart before it appears inovertacts so he accused you as a traitor on that account and thereforeinsisted you should be put to deaththe treasurer was of the same opinion he showed to what straits hismajestys revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you whichwould soon grow insupportable that the secretarys expedient of puttingout your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this evil that itwould probably increase it as is manifest from the common practice ofblinding some kind of fowls after which they fed the faster and grewsooner fat that his sacred majesty and the council who are your judgeswere in their own consciences fully convinced of your guilt which wasa sufficient argument to condemn you to death without the formal proofsrequired by the strict letter of the lawbut his imperial majesty fully determined against capital punishmentwas graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss ofyour eyes too easy a censure some other way may be inflicted hereafterand your friend the secretary humbly desiring to be heard again inanswer to what the treasurer had objected concerning the great chargehis majesty was at in maintaining you said that his excellency who hadthe sole disposal of the emperors revenue might easily provide againstthat evil by gradually lessening your establishment by which for wantof sufficient for you would grow weak and faint and lose your appetiteand consequently decay and consume in a few months neither would thestench of your carcass be then so dangerous when it should become morethan half diminished and immediately upon your death five or sixthousand of his majestys subjects might in two or three days cut yourflesh from your bones take it away by cartloads and bury it in distantparts to prevent infection leaving the skeleton as a monument ofadmiration to posteritythus by the great friendship of the secretary the whole affair wascompromised  it was strictly enjoined that the project of starving youby degrees should be kept a secret but the sentence of putting out youreyes was entered on the books none dissenting except bolgolam theadmiral who being a creature of the empress was perpetually instigatedby her majesty to insist upon your death she having borne perpetualmalice against you on account of that infamous and illegal method youtook to extinguish the fire in her apartmentin three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to yourhouse and read before you the articles of impeachment and then tosignify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council wherebyyou are only condemned to the loss of your eyes which his majesty doesnot question you will gratefully and humbly submit to and twenty of hismajestys surgeons will attend in order to see the operation wellperformed by discharging very sharppointed arrows into the balls ofyour eyes as you lie on the groundi leave to your prudence what measures you will take and to avoidsuspicion i must immediately return in as private a manner as i camehis lordship did so and i remained alone under many doubts andperplexities of mindit was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry verydifferent as i have been assured from the practice of former timesthat after the court had decreed any cruel execution either to gratifythe monarchs resentment or the malice of a favourite the emperoralways made a speech to his whole council expressing his great lenityand tenderness as qualities known and confessed by all the world  thisspeech was immediately published throughout the kingdom nor did anything terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majestysmercy because it was observed that the more these praises were enlargedand insisted on the more inhuman was the punishment and the sufferermore innocent  yet as to myself i must confess having never beendesigned for a courtier either by my birth or education i was so ill ajudge of things that i could not discover the lenity and favour of thissentence but conceived it perhaps erroneously rather to be rigorousthan gentle  i sometimes thought of standing my trial for although icould not deny the facts alleged in the several articles yet i hopedthey would admit of some extenuation  but having in my life perused manystatetrials which i ever observed to terminate as the judges thoughtfit to direct i durst not rely on so dangerous a decision in socritical a juncture and against such powerful enemies  once i wasstrongly bent upon resistance for while i had liberty the wholestrength of that empire could hardly subdue me and i might easily withstones pelt the metropolis to pieces but i soon rejected that projectwith horror by remembering the oath i had made to the emperor thefavours i received from him and the high title of nardac he conferredupon me  neither had i so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers topersuade myself that his majestys present seventies acquitted me of allpast obligationsat last i fixed upon a resolution for which it is probable i may incursome censure and not unjustly for i confess i owe the preserving ofmine eyes and consequently my liberty to my own great rashness and wantof experience because if i had then known the nature of princes andministers which i have since observed in many other courts and theirmethods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself i should withgreat alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy a punishmentbut hurried on by the precipitancy of youth and having his imperialmajestys license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of blefuscu itook this opportunity before the three days were elapsed to send aletter to my friend the secretary signifying my resolution of settingout that morning for blefuscu pursuant to the leave i had got andwithout waiting for an answer i went to that side of the island whereour fleet lay  i seized a large man of war tied a cable to the prowand lifting up the anchors i stripped myself put my clothes togetherwith my coverlet which i carried under my arm into the vessel anddrawing it after me between wading and swimming arrived at the royalport of blefuscu where the people had long expected me they lent me twoguides to direct me to the capital city which is of the same name  iheld them in my hands till i came within two hundred yards of the gateand desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries andlet him know i there waited his majestys command  i had an answer inabout an hour that his majesty attended by the royal family and greatofficers of the court was coming out to receive me  i advanced ahundred yards  the emperor and his train alighted from their horses theempress and ladies from their coaches and i did not perceive they werein any fright or concern  i lay on the ground to kiss his majestys andthe empresss hands  i told his majesty that i was come according tomy promise and with the license of the emperor my master to have thehonour of seeing so mighty a monarch and to offer him any service in mypower consistent with my duty to my own prince not mentioning a wordof my disgrace because i had hitherto no regular information of it andmight suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design neither could ireasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret while iwas out of his power wherein however it soon appeared i was deceivedi shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of myreception at this court which was suitable to the generosity of so greata prince nor of the difficulties i was in for want of a house and bedbeing forced to lie on the ground wrapped up in my coverletchapter viiithe author by a lucky accident finds means to leave blefuscu andafter some difficulties returns safe to his native countrythree days after my arrival walking out of curiosity to the northeastcoast of the island i observed about half a league off in the seasomewhat that looked like a boat overturned  i pulled off my shoes andstockings and wailing two or three hundred yards i found the object toapproach nearer by force of the tide and then plainly saw it to be areal boat which i supposed might by some tempest have been driven from aship  whereupon i returned immediately towards the city and desiredhis imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he hadleft after the loss of his fleet and three thousand seamen under thecommand of his viceadmiral  this fleet sailed round while i went backthe shortest way to the coast where i first discovered the boat  ifound the tide had driven it still nearer  the seamen were all providedwith cordage which i had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strengthwhen the ships came up i stripped myself and waded till i came within ahundred yards off the boat after which i was forced to swim till i gotup to it  the seamen threw me the end of the cord which i fastened to ahole in the forepart of the boat and the other end to a man of war buti found all my labour to little purpose for being out of my depth iwas not able to work  in this necessity i was forced to swim behind andpush the boat forward as often as i could with one of my hands and thetide favouring me i advanced so far that i could just hold up my chinand feel the ground  i rested two or three minutes and then gave theboat another shove and so on till the sea was no higher than myarmpits and now the most laborious part being over i took out myother cables which were stowed in one of the ships and fastened themfirst to the boat and then to nine of the vessels which attended me thewind being favourable the seamen towed and i shoved until we arrivedwithin forty yards of the shore and waiting till the tide was out igot dry to the boat and by the assistance of two thousand men withropes and engines i made a shift to turn it on its bottom and found itwas but little damagedi shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties i was under by thehelp of certain paddles which cost me ten days making to get my boat tothe royal port of blefuscu where a mighty concourse of people appearedupon my arrival full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vesseli told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my wayto carry me to some place whence i might return into my native countryand begged his majestys orders for getting materials to fit it uptogether with his license to depart which after some kindexpostulations he was pleased to granti did very much wonder in all this time not to have heard of anyexpress relating to me from our emperor to the court of blefuscu  but iwas afterward given privately to understand that his imperial majestynever imagining i had the least notice of his designs believed i wasonly gone to blefuscu in performance of my promise according to thelicense he had given me which was well known at our court and wouldreturn in a few days when the ceremony was ended  but he was at last inpain at my long absence and after consulting with the treasurer and therest of that cabal a person of quality was dispatched with the copy ofthe articles against me  this envoy had instructions to represent to themonarch of blefuscu the great lenity of his master who was content topunish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes that i had fledfrom justice and if i did not return in two hours i should be deprivedof my title of nardac and declared a traitor  the envoy furtheradded that in order to maintain the peace and amity between bothempires his master expected that his brother of blefuscu would giveorders to have me sent back to lilliput bound hand and foot to bepunished as a traitorthe emperor of blefuscu having taken three days to consult returned ananswer consisting of many civilities and excuses  he said that as forsending me bound his brother knew it was impossible that although ihad deprived him of his fleet yet he owed great obligations to me formany good offices i had done him in making the peace  that howeverboth their majesties would soon be made easy for i had found aprodigious vessel on the shore able to carry me on the sea which he hadgiven orders to fit up with my own assistance and direction and hehoped in a few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportablean encumbrancewith this answer the envoy returned to lilliput and the monarch ofblefuscu related to me all that had passed offering me at the same timebut under the strictest confidence his gracious protection if i wouldcontinue in his service wherein although i believed him sincere yet iresolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers wherei could possibly avoid it and therefore with all due acknowledgmentsfor his favourable intentions i humbly begged to be excused  i toldhim that since fortune whether good or evil had thrown a vessel in myway i was resolved to venture myself on the ocean rather than be anoccasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs  neither did ifind the emperor at all displeased and i discovered by a certainaccident that he was very glad of my resolution and so were most of hisministersthese considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner thani intended to which the court impatient to have me gone very readilycontributed  five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to myboat according to my directions by quilting thirteen folds of theirstrongest linen together  i was at the pains of making ropes and cablesby twisting ten twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest oftheirs  a great stone that i happened to find after a long search bythe seashore served me for an anchor  i had the tallow of threehundred cows for greasing my boat and other uses  i was at incrediblepains in cutting down some of the largest timbertrees for oars andmasts wherein i was however much assisted by his majestysshipcarpenters who helped me in smoothing them after i had done therough workin about a month when all was prepared i sent to receive his majestyscommands and to take my leave  the emperor and royal family came out ofthe palace i lay down on my face to kiss his hand which he verygraciously gave me so did the empress and young princes of the bloodhis majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugsapiece together with his picture at full length which i putimmediately into one of my gloves to keep it from being hurt  theceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with atthis timei stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen and three hundredsheep with bread and drink proportionable and as much meat readydressed as four hundred cooks could provide  i took with me six cows andtwo bulls alive with as many ewes and rams intending to carry them intomy own country and propagate the breed  and to feed them on board ihad a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn  i would gladly have taken adozen of the natives but this was a thing the emperor would by no meanspermit and besides a diligent search into my pockets his majestyengaged my honour not to carry away any of his subjects although withtheir own consent and desirehaving thus prepared all things as well as i was able i set sail on thetwentyfourth day of september  at six in the morning and when ihad gone about fourleagues to the northward the wind being atsoutheast at six in the evening i descried a small island about half aleague to the northwest  i advanced forward and cast anchor on theleeside of the island which seemed to be uninhabited  i then took somerefreshment and went to my rest  i slept well and as i conjectured atleast six hours for i found the day broke in two hours after i awakedit was a clear night  i ate my breakfast before the sun was up andheaving anchor the wind being favourable i steered the same course thati had done the day before wherein i was directed by my pocket compassmy intention was to reach if possible one of those islands which i hadreason to believe lay to the northeast of van diemens land  idiscovered nothing all that day but upon the next about three in theafternoon when i had by my computation made twentyfour leagues fromblefuscu i descried a sail steering to the southeast my course was dueeast  i hailed her but could get no answer yet i found i gained uponher for the wind slackened  i made all the sail i could and in half anhour she spied me then hung out her ancient and discharged a gun  itis not easy to express the joy i was in upon the unexpected hope of oncemore seeing my beloved country and the dear pledges i left in it  theship slackened her sails and i came up with her between five and six inthe evening september th but my heart leaped within me to see herenglish colours  i put my cows and sheep into my coatpockets and goton board with all my little cargo of provisions  the vessel was anenglish merchantman returning from japan by the north and south seasthe captain mr john biddel of deptford a very civil man and anexcellent sailorwe were now in the latitude of  degrees south there were about fiftymen in the ship and here i met an old comrade of mine one peterwilliams who gave me a good character to the captain  this gentlemantreated me with kindness and desired i would let him know what place icame from last and whither i was bound which i did in a few words buthe thought i was raving and that the dangers i underwent had disturbedmy head whereupon i took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocketwhich after great astonishment clearly convinced him of my veracity  ithen showed him the gold given me by the emperor of blefuscu togetherwith his majestys picture at full length and some other rarities ofthat country  i gave him two purses of two hundreds sprugs each andpromised when we arrived in england to make him a present of a cow anda sheep big with youngi shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyagewhich was very prosperous for the most part  we arrived in the downs onthe th of april   i had only one misfortune that the rats onboard carried away one of my sheep i found her bones in a hole pickedclean from the flesh  the rest of my cattle i got safe ashore and setthem agrazing in a bowlinggreen at greenwich where the fineness of thegrass made them feed very heartily though i had always feared thecontrary neither could i possibly have preserved them in so long avoyage if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuitwhich rubbed to powder and mingled with water was their constant foodthe short time i continued in england i made a considerable profit byshowing my cattle to many persons of quality and others and before ibegan my second voyage i sold them for six hundred pounds  since mylast return i find the breed is considerably increased especially thesheep which i hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollenmanufacture by the fineness of the fleecesi stayed but two months with my wife and family for my insatiable desireof seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer  ileft fifteen hundred pounds with my wife and fixed her in a good houseat redriff  my remaining stock i carried with me part in money and partin goods in hopes to improve my fortunes  my eldest uncle john had leftme an estate in land

and to about five degrees southlatitude the winds which in those seas are observed to blow a constantequal gale between the north and west from the beginning of december tothe beginning of may on the th of april began to blow with muchgreater violence and more westerly than usual continuing so for twentydays together during which time we were driven a little to the east ofthe molucca islands and about three degrees northward of the line asour captain found by an observation he took the nd of may at which timethe wind ceased and it was a perfect calm whereat i was not a littlerejoiced  but he being a man well experienced in the navigation ofthose seas bid us all prepare against a storm which accordinglyhappened the day following for the southern wind called the southernmonsoon began to set infinding it was likely to overblow we took in our spritsail and stoodby to hand the foresail but making foul weather we looked the gunswere all fast and handed the mizen  the ship lay very broad off

hauled offupon the laniard of the whipstaff and helped the man at the helm  wewould not get down our topmast but let all stand because she scuddedbefore the sea very well and we knew that the topmast

out well our ship was staunchand our crew all in good health but we lay in the utmost distress forwater  we thought it best to hold on the same course rather than turnmore northerly which might have brought us to the northwest part ofgreat tartary and into the frozen seaon the th day of june  a boy on the topmast discovered land  onthe th we came in full view of a great island or continent for weknew not whether on the south side whereof was a small neck of landjutting out into the sea and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of aboveone hundred tons  we cast anchor within a league of this creek and ourcaptain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the longboat with vesselsfor water if any could be found  i desired his leave to go with themthat i might see the country and make what discoveries i could  when wecame to land we saw no river or spring nor any sign of inhabitants  ourmen therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near thesea and i walked alone about a mile on the other side where i observedthe country all barren and rocky  i now began to be weary and seeingnothing to entertain my curiosity i returned gently down towards thecreek and the sea being full in my view i saw our men already got intothe boat and rowing for life to the ship  i was going to holla afterthem although it had been to little purpose when i observed a hugecreature walking after them in the sea as fast as he could he waded notmuch deeper than his knees and took prodigious strides but our men hadthe start of him half a league and the sea thereabouts being full ofsharppointed rocks the monster was not able to overtake the boat  thisi was afterwards told for i durst not stay to see the issue of theadventure but ran as fast as i could the way i first went and thenclimbed up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the country  ifound it fully cultivated but that which first surprised me was thelength of the grass which in those grounds that seemed to be kept forhay was about twenty feet highi fell into a high road for so i took it to be though it served to theinhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley  here i walkedon for some time but could see little on either side it being now nearharvest and the corn rising at least forty feet  i was an hour walkingto the end of this field which was fenced in with a hedge of at leastone hundred and twenty feet high and the trees so lofty that i couldmake no computation of their altitude  there was a stile to pass fromthis field into the next  it had four steps and a stone to cross overwhen you came to the uppermost  it was impossible for me to climb thisstile because every step was sixfeet high and the upper stone abouttwenty  i was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge when idiscovered one of the inhabitants in the next field advancing towardsthe stile of the same size with him whom i saw in the sea pursuing ourboat  he appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple and took aboutten yards at every stride as near as i could guess  i was struck withthe utmost fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself in the cornwhence i saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next fieldon the right hand and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder thana speakingtrumpet but the noise was so high in the air that at first icertainly thought it was thunder  whereupon seven monsters likehimself came towards him with reapinghooks in their hands each hookabout the largeness of six scythes  these people were not so well cladas the first whose servants or labourers they seemed to be for uponsome words he spoke they went to reap the corn in the field where i layi kept from them at as great a distance as i could but was forced tomove with extreme difficulty for the stalks of the corn were sometimesnot above a foot distant so that i could hardly squeeze my body betwixtthem  however i made a shift to go forward till i came to a part ofthe field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind  here it wasimpossible for me to advance a step for the stalks were so interwoventhat i could not creep through and the beards of the fallen ears sostrong and pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my fleshat the same time i heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind mebeing quite dispirited with toil and wholly overcome by grief anddispair i lay down between two ridges and heartily wished i might thereend my days  i bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children  ilamented my own folly and wilfulness in attempting a second voyageagainst the advice of all my friends and relations  in this terribleagitation of mind i could not forbear thinking of lilliput whoseinhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared inthe world where i was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand andperform those other actions which will be recorded for ever in thechronicles of that empire while posterity shall hardly believe themalthough attested by millions  i reflected what a mortification it mustprove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one singlelilliputian would be among us  but this i conceived was to be the leastof my misfortunes for as human creatures are observed to be more savageand cruel in proportion to their bulk what could i expect but to be amorsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians thatshould happen to seize me  undoubtedly philosophers are in the rightwhen they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than bycomparison  it might have pleased fortune to have let the lilliputiansfind some nation where the people were as diminutive with respect tothem as they were to me  and who knows but that even this prodigiousrace of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of theworld whereof we have yet no discoveryscared and confounded as i was i could not forbear going on with thesereflections when one of the reapers approaching within ten yards of theridge where i lay made me apprehend that with the next step i should besquashed to death under his foot or cut in two with his reapinghookand therefore when he was again about to move i screamed as loud asfear could make me whereupon the huge creature trod short and lookinground about under him for some time at last espied me as i lay on theground  he considered awhile with the caution of one who endeavours tolay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall notbe able either to scratch or bite him as i myself have sometimes donewith a weasel in england  at length he ventured to take me behind bythe middle between his forefinger and thumb and brought me withinthree yards of his eyes that he might behold my shape more perfectly  iguessed his meaning and my good fortune gave me so much presence ofmind that i resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in theair above sixty feet from the ground although he grievously pinched mysides for fear i should slip through his fingers  all i ventured was toraise mine eyes towards the sun and place my hands together in asupplicating posture and to speak some words in a humble melancholytone suitable to the condition i then was in for i apprehended everymoment that he would dash me against the ground as we usually do anylittle hateful animal which we have a mind to destroy  but my good starwould have it that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures andbegan to look upon me as a curiosity much wondering to hear me pronouncearticulate words although he could not understand them  in the meantime i was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears and turningmy head towards my sides letting him know as well as i could howcruelly i was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger  he seemed toapprehend my meaning for lifting up the lappet of his coat he put megently into it and immediately ran along with me to his master who wasa substantial farmer and the same person i had first seen in the fieldthe farmer having as i suppose by their talk received such an accountof me as his servant could give him took a piece of a small straw aboutthe size of a walkingstaff and therewith lifted up the lappets of mycoat which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that naturehad given me  he blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my facehe called his hinds about him and asked them as i afterwards learnedwhether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature thatresembled me  he then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours buti got immediately up and walked slowly backward and forward to letthose people see i had no intent to run away  they all sat down in acircle about me the better to observe my motions  i pulled off my hatand made a low bow towards the farmer  i fell on my knees and lifted upmy hands and eyes and spoke several words as loud as i could i took apurse of gold out of my pocket and humbly presented it to him  hereceived it on the palm of his hand then applied it close to his eye tosee what it was and afterwards turned it several times with the point ofa pin which he took out of his sleeve but could make nothing of itwhereupon i made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground  ithen took the purse and opening it poured all the gold into his palmthere were six spanish pieces of four pistoles each beside twenty orthirty smaller coins  i saw him wet the tip of his little finger uponhis tongue and take up one of my largest pieces and then another buthe seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were  he made me a sign to putthem again into my purse and the purse again into my pocket whichafter offering it to him several times i thought it best to dothe farmer by this time was convinced i must be a rational creaturehe spoke often to me but the sound of his voice pierced my ears likethat of a watermill yet his words were articulate enough  i answeredas loud as i could in several languages and he often laid his ear withintwo yards of me but all in vain for we were wholly unintelligible toeach other  he then sent his servants to their work and taking hishandkerchief out of his pocket he doubled and spread it on his lefthand which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward making mea sign to step into it as i could easily do for it was not above a footin thickness  i thought it my part to obey and for fear of fallinglaid myself at full length upon the handkerchief with the remainder ofwhich he lapped me up to the head for further security and in thismanner carried me home to his house  there he called his wife andshowed me to her but she screamed and ran back as women in england doat the sight of a toad or a spider  however when she had a while seenmy behaviour and how well i observed the signs her husband made she wassoon reconciled and by degrees grew extremely tender of meit was about twelve at noon and a servant brought in dinner  it wasonly one substantial dish of meat fit for the plain condition of ahusbandman in a dish of about fourandtwenty feet diameter  thecompany were the farmer and his wife three children and an oldgrandmother  when they were sat down the farmer placed me at somedistance from him on the table which was thirty feet high from thefloor  i was in a terrible fright and kept as far as i could from theedge for fear of falling  the wife minced a bit of meat then crumbledsome bread on a trencher and placed it before me  i made her a low bowtook out my knife and fork and fell to eat which gave them exceedingdelight  the mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup which heldabout two gallons and filled it with drink i took up the vessel withmuch difficulty in both hands and in a most respectful manner drank toher ladyships health expressing the words as loud as i could inenglish which made the company laugh so heartily that i was almostdeafened with the noise  this liquor tasted like a small cider and wasnot unpleasant  then the master made me a sign to come to his trencherside but as i walked on the table being in great surprise all the timeas the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse i happened tostumble against a crust and fell flat on my face but received no hurti got up immediately and observing the good people to be in muchconcern i took my hat which i held under my arm out of good mannersand waving it over my head made three huzzas to show i had got nomischief by my fall  but advancing forward towards my master as i shallhenceforth call him his youngest son who sat next to him an arch boyof about ten years old took me up by the legs and held me so high inthe air that i trembled every limb but his father snatched me from himand at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear as would havefelled an european troop of horse to the earth ordering him to be takenfrom the table  but being afraid the boy might owe me a spite and wellremembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are tosparrows rabbits young kittens and puppy dogs i fell on my knees andpointing to the boy made my master to understand as well as i couldthat i desired his son might be pardoned  the father complied and thelad took his seat again whereupon i went to him and kissed his handwhich my master took and made him stroke me gently with itin the midst of dinner my mistresss favourite cat leaped into her lapi heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stockingweavers at workand turning my head i found it proceeded from the purring of thatanimal who seemed to be three times larger than an ox as i computed bythe view of her head and one of her paws while her mistress was feedingand stroking her  the fierceness of this creatures countenancealtogether discomposed me though i stood at the farther end of thetable above fifty feet off and although my mistress held her fast forfear she might give a spring and seize me in her talons  but ithappened there was no danger for the cat took not the least notice of mewhen my master placed me within three yards of her  and as i have beenalways told and found true by experience in my travels that flying ordiscovering fear before a fierce animal is a certain way to make itpursue or attack you so i resolved in this dangerous juncture to showno manner of concern  i walked with intrepidity five or six times beforethe very head of the cat and came within half a yard of her whereuponshe drew herself back as if she were more afraid of me i had lessapprehension concerning the dogs whereof three or four came into theroom as it is usual in farmers houses one of which was a mastiffequal in bulk to four elephants and another a greyhound somewhat tallerthan the mastiff but not so largewhen dinner was almost done the nurse came in with a child of a year oldin her arms who immediately spied me and began a squall that you mighthave heard from londonbridge to chelsea after the usual oratory ofinfants to get me for a plaything  the mother out of pure indulgencetook me up and put me towards the child who presently seized me by themiddle and got my head into his mouth where i roared so loud that theurchin was frighted and let me drop and i should infallibly have brokemy neck if the mother had not held her apron under me  the nurse toquiet her babe made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vesselfilled with great stones and fastened by a cable to the childs waistbut all in vain so that she was forced to apply the last remedy bygiving it suck  i must confess no object ever disgusted me so much asthe sight of her monstrous breast which i cannot tell what to comparewith so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk shape andcolour  it stood prominent six feet and could not be less than sixteenin circumference  the nipple was about half the bigness of my head andthe hue both of that and the dug so varied with spots pimples andfreckles that nothing could appear more nauseous for i had a near sightof her she sitting down the more conveniently to give suck and istanding on the table  this made me reflect upon the fair skins of ourenglish ladies who appear so beautiful to us only because they are ofour own size and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifyingglass where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skinslook rough and coarse and illcolouredi remember when i was at lilliput the complexion of those diminutivepeople appeared to me the fairest in the world and talking upon thissubject with a person of learning there who was an intimate friend ofmine he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when helooked on me from the ground than it did upon a nearer view when i tookhim up in my hand and brought him close which he confessed was at firsta very shocking sight  he said he could discover great holes in myskin that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than thebristles of a boar and my complexion made up of several coloursaltogether disagreeable although i must beg leave to say for myselfthat i am as fair as most of my sex and country and very little sunburntby all my travels  on the other side discoursing of the ladies in thatemperors court he used to tell me one had freckles another too widea mouth a third too large a nose nothing of which i was able todistinguish  i confess this reflection was obvious enough whichhowever i could not forbear lest the reader might think those vastcreatures were actually deformed for i must do them the justice to saythey are a comely race of people and particularly the features of mymasters countenance although he was but a farmer when i beheld himfrom the height of sixty feet appeared very well proportionedwhen dinner was done my master went out to his labourers and as icould discover by his voice and gesture gave his wife strict charge totake care of me  i was very much tired and disposed to sleep which mymistress perceiving she put me on her own bed and covered me with aclean white handkerchief but larger and coarser than the mainsail of amanofwari slept about two hours and dreamt i was at home with my wife andchildren which aggravated my sorrows when i awaked and found myselfalone in a vast room between two and three hundred feet wide and abovetwo hundred high lying in a bed twenty yards wide  my mistress was goneabout her household affairs and had locked me in  the bed was eightyards from the floor  some natural necessities required me to get downi durst not presume to call and if i had it would have been in vainwith such a voice as mine at so great a distance from the room where ilay to the kitchen where the family kept  while i was under thesecircumstances two rats crept up the curtains and ran smelling backwardsand forwards on the bed  one of them came up almost to my facewhereupon i rose in a fright and drew out my hanger to defend myselfthese horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides andone of them held his forefeet at my collar but i had the good fortuneto rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief  he fell down atmy feet and the other seeing the fate of his comrade made his escapebut not without one good wound on the back which i gave him as he fledand made the blood run trickling from him  after this exploit i walkedgently to and fro on the bed to recover my breath and loss of spiritsthese creatures were of the size of a large mastiff but infinitely morenimble and fierce so that if i had taken off my belt before i went tosleep i must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured  imeasured the tail of the dead rat and found it to be two yards longwanting an inch but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass offthe bed where it lay still bleeding i observed it had yet some lifebut with a strong slash across the neck i thoroughly despatched itsoon after my mistress came into the room who seeing me all bloody ranand took me up in her hand  i pointed to the dead rat smiling andmaking other signs to show i was not hurt whereat she was extremelyrejoiced calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongsand throw it out of the window  then she set me on a table where ishowed her my hanger all bloody and wiping it on the lappet of my coatreturned it to the scabbard  i was pressed to do more than one thingwhich another could not do for me and therefore endeavoured to make mymistress understand that i desired to be set down on the floor whichafter she had done my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myselffarther than by pointing to the door and bowing several times  thegood woman with much difficulty at last perceived what i would be atand taking me up again in her hand walked into the garden where she setme down  i went on one side about two hundred yards and beckoning toher not to look or to follow me i hid myself between two leaves ofsorrel and there discharged the necessities of naturei hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and thelike particulars which however insignificant they may appear togroveling vulgar minds yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlargehis thoughts and imagination and apply them to the benefit of public aswell as private life which was my sole design in presenting this andother accounts of my travels to the world wherein i have been chieflystudious of truth without affecting any ornaments of learning or ofstyle  but the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impressionon my mind and is so deeply fixed in my memory that in committing itto paper i did not omit one material circumstance however upon a strictreview i blotted out several passages  of less moment which were in myfirst copy for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling whereoftravellers are often perhaps not without justice accusedchapter iia description of the farmers daughter  the author carried to amarkettown and then to the metropolis  the particulars of his journeymy mistress had a daughter of nine years old a child of towardly partsfor her age very dexterous at her needle and skilful in dressing herbaby  her mother and she contrived to fit up the babys cradle for meagainst night the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet andthe drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats  this was mybed all the time i staid with those people though made more convenientby degrees as i began to learn their language and make my wants knownthis young girl was so handy that after i had once or twice pulled offmy clothes before her she was able to dress and undress me though inever gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself  shemade me seven shirts and some other linen of as fine cloth as could begot which indeed was coarser than sackcloth and these she constantlywashed for me with her own hands  she was likewise my schoolmistressto teach me the language when i pointed to any thing she told me thename of it in her own tongue so that in a few days i was able to callfor whatever i had a mind to  she was very goodnatured and not aboveforty feet high being little for her age  she gave me the name ofgrildrig which the family took up and afterwards the whole kingdomthe word imports what the latins call nanunculus the italianshomunceletino and the english mannikin  to her i chiefly owe mypreservation in that country we never parted while i was there i calledher my glumdalclitch or little nurse and should be guilty of greatingratitude if i omitted this honourable mention of her care andaffection towards me which i heartily wish it lay in my power to requiteas she deserves instead of being the innocent but unhappy instrument ofher disgrace as i have too much reason to fearit now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood that mymaster had found a strange animal in the field about the bigness of asplacnuck but exactly shaped in every part like a human creaturewhich it likewise imitated in all its actions seemed to speak in alittle language of its own had already learned several words of theirswent erect upon two legs was tame and gentle would come when it wascalled do whatever it was bid had the finest limbs in the world and acomplexion fairer than a noblemans daughter of three years old  anotherfarmer who lived hard by and was a particular friend of my master cameon a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story  i wasimmediately produced and placed upon a table where i walked as i wascommanded drew my hanger put it up again made my reverence to mymasters guest asked him in his own language how he did and told himhe was welcome just as my little nurse had instructed me  this manwho was old and dimsighted put on his spectacles to behold me betterat which i could not forbear laughing very heartily for his eyesappeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows  ourpeople who discovered the cause of my mirth bore me company inlaughing at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out ofcountenance  he had the character of a great miser and to mymisfortune he well deserved it by the cursed advice he gave my masterto show me as a sight upon a marketday in the next town which was halfan hours riding about twoandtwenty miles from our house  i guessedthere was some mischief when i observed my master and his friendwhispering together sometimes pointing at me and my fears made me fancythat i overheard and understood some of their words  but the nextmorning glumdalclitch my little nurse told me the whole matter whichshe had cunningly picked out from her mother  the poor girl laid me onher bosom and fell a weeping with shame and grief  she apprehended somemischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks who might squeeze meto death or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands  she hadalso observed how modest i was in my nature how nicely i regarded myhonour and what an indignity i should conceive it to be exposed formoney as a public spectacle to the meanest of the people  she said herpapa and mamma had promised that grildrig should be hers but now shefound they meant to serve her as they did last year when they pretendedto give her a lamb and yet as soon as it was fat sold it to a butcherfor my own part i may truly affirm that i was less concerned than mynurse  i had a strong hope which never left me that i should one dayrecover my liberty and as to the ignominy of being carried about for amonster i considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country andthat such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach ifever i should return to england since the king of great britain himselfin my condition must have undergone the same distressmy master pursuant to the advice of his friend carried me in a box thenext marketday to the neighbouring town and took along with him hislittle daughter my nurse upon a pillion behind him  the box was closeon every side with a little door for me to go in and out and a fewgimlet holes to let in air  the girl had been so careful as to put thequilt of her babys bed into it for me to lie down on  however i wasterribly shaken and discomposed in this journey though it was but ofhalf an hour for the horse went about forty feet at every step andtrotted so high that the agitation was equal to the rising and fallingof a ship in a great storm but much more frequent  our journey wassomewhat farther than from london to st albans  my master alighted atan inn which he used to frequent and after consulting awhile with theinnkeeper and making some necessary preparations he hired thegrultrud or crier to give notice through the town of a strangecreature to be seen at the sign of the green eagle not so big as asplacnuck an animal in that country very finely shaped about six feetlong and in every part of the body resembling a human creature couldspeak several words and perform a hundred diverting tricksi was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn which might benear three hundred feet square  my little nurse stood on a low stoolclose to the table to take care of me and direct what i should do  mymaster to avoid a crowd would suffer only thirty people at a time tosee me  i walked about on the table as the girl commanded she asked mequestions as far as she knew my understanding of the language reachedand i answered them as loud as i could  i turned about several times tothe company paid my humble respects said they were welcome and usedsome other speeches i had been taught  i took up a thimble filled withliquor which glumdalclitch had given me for a cup and drank theirhealth i drew out my hanger and flourished with it after the manner offencers in england  my nurse gave me a part of a straw which iexercised as a pike having learnt the art in my youth  i was that dayshown to twelve sets of company and as often forced to act over againthe same fopperies till i was half dead with weariness and vexation forthose who had seen me made such wonderful reports that the people wereready to break down the doors to come in  my master for his owninterest would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse and toprevent danger benches were set round the table at such a distance as toput me out of every bodys reach  however an unlucky schoolboy aimed ahazel nut directly at my head which very narrowly missed me otherwiseit came with so much violence that it would have infallibly knocked outmy brains for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin but i had thesatisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten and turned out of theroommy master gave public notice that he would show me again the nextmarketday and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for mewhich he had reason enough to do for i was so tired with my firstjourney and with entertaining company for eight hours together that icould hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word  it was at least threedays before i recovered my strength and that i might have no rest athome all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round hearingof my fame came to see me at my masters own house  there could not befewer than thirty persons with their wives and children for the countryis very populous and my master demanded the rate of a full roomwhenever he showed me at home although it were only to a single familyso that for some time i had but little ease every day of the week exceptwednesday which is their sabbath although i were not carried to thetownmy master finding how profitable i was likely to be resolved to carryme to the most considerable cities of the kingdom  having thereforeprovided himself with all things necessary for a long journey andsettled his affairs at home he took leave of his wife and upon the thof august  about two months after my arrival we set out for themetropolis situate near the middle of that empire and about threethousand miles distance from our house  my master made his daughterglumdalclitch ride behind him  she carried me on her lap in a box tiedabout her waist  the girl had lined it on all sides with the softestcloth she could get well quilted underneath furnished it with herbabys bed provided me with linen and other necessaries and madeeverything as convenient as she could  we had no other company but a boyof the house who rode after us with the luggagemy masters design was to show me in all the towns by the way and tostep out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles to any village orperson of qualitys house where he might expect custom  we made easyjourneys of not above seven or eight score miles aday forglumdalclitch on purpose to spare me complained she was tired with thetrotting of the horse  she often took me out of my box at my owndesire to give me air and show me the country but always held me fastby a leadingstring  we passed over five or six rivers many degreesbroader and deeper than the nile or the ganges and there was hardly arivulet so small as the thames at londonbridge  we were ten weeks inour journey and i was shown in eighteen large towns besides manyvillages and private familieson the th day of october we arrived at the metropolis called in theirlanguage lorbrulgrud or pride of the universe  my master took alodging in the principal street of the city not far from the royalpalace and put out bills in the usual form containing an exactdescription of my person and parts  he hired a large room between threeand four hundred feet wide  he provided a table sixty feet in diameterupon which i was to act my part and pallisadoed it round three feet fromthe edge and as many high to prevent my falling over  i was shown tentimes aday to the wonder and satisfaction of all people  i could nowspeak the language tolerably well and perfectly understood every wordthat was spoken to me  besides i had learnt their alphabet and couldmake a shift to explain a sentence here and there for glumdalclitch hadbeen my instructor while we were at home and at leisure hours during ourjourney  she carried a little book in her pocket not much larger than asansons atlas it was a common treatise for the use of young girlsgiving a short account of their religion out of this she taught me myletters and interpreted the wordschapter iiithe author sent for to court  the queen buys him of his master thefarmer and presents him to the king  he disputes with his majestysgreat scholars  an apartment at court provided for the author  he is inhigh favour with the queen  he stands up for the honour of his owncountry  his quarrels with the queens dwarfthe frequent labours i underwent every day made in a few weeks a veryconsiderable change in my health the more my master got by me the moreinsatiable he grew  i had quite lost my stomach and was almost reducedto a skeleton  the farmer observed it and concluding i must soon dieresolved to make as good a hand of me as he could  while he was thusreasoning and resolving with himself a sardral or gentlemanushercame from court commanding my master to carry me immediately thither forthe diversion of the queen and her ladies  some of the latter hadalready been to see me and reported strange things of my beautybehaviour and good sense  her majesty and those who attended her werebeyond measure delighted with my demeanour  i fell on my knees andbegged the honour of kissing her imperial foot but this graciousprincess held out her little finger towards me after i was set on thetable which i embraced in both my arms and put the tip of it with theutmost respect to my lip  she made me some general questions about mycountry and my travels which i answered as distinctly and in as fewwords as i could  she asked whether i could be content to live atcourt  i bowed down to the board of the table and humbly answeredthat i was my masters slave but if i were at my own disposal ishould be proud to devote my life to her majestys service  she thenasked my master whether he was willing to sell me at a good pricehe who apprehended i could not live a month was ready enough to partwith me and demanded a thousand pieces of gold which were ordered himon the spot each piece being about the bigness of eight hundredmoidores but allowing for the proportion of all things between thatcountry and europe and the high price of gold among them was hardly sogreat a sum as a thousand guineas would be in england  i then said tothe queen since i was now her majestys most humble creature andvassal i must beg the favour that glumdalclitch who had always tendedme with so much care and kindness and understood to do it so well mightbe admitted into her service and continue to be my nurse andinstructorher majesty agreed to my petition and easily got the farmers consentwho was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court and the poorgirl herself was not able to hide her joy  my late master withdrewbidding me farewell and saying he had left me in a good service towhich i replied not a word only making him a slight bowthe queen observed my coldness and when the farmer was gone out of theapartment asked me the reason  i made bold to tell her majesty that iowed no other obligation to my late master than his not dashing out thebrains of a poor harmless creature found by chance in his fields whichobligation was amply recompensed by the gain he had made in showing methrough half the kingdom and the price he had now sold me for  that thelife i had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten timesmy strength  that my health was much impaired by the continual drudgeryof entertaining the rabble every hour of the day and that if my masterhad not thought my life in danger her majesty would not have got socheap a bargain  but as i was out of all fear of being illtreated underthe protection of so great and good an empress the ornament of naturethe darling of the world the delight of her subjects the phoenix of thecreation so i hoped my late masters apprehensions would appear to begroundless for i already found my spirits revive by the influence ofher most august presencethis was the sum of my speech delivered with great improprieties andhesitation  the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiarto that people whereof i learned some phrases from glumdalclitch whileshe was carrying me to courtthe queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking washowever surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive ananimal  she took me in her own hand and carried me to the king who wasthen retired to his cabinet  his majesty a prince of much gravity andaustere countenance not well observing my shape at first view asked thequeen after a cold manner how long it was since she grew fond of asplacnuck for such it seems he took me to be as i lay upon my breastin her majestys right hand  but this princess who has an infinite dealof wit and humour set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire andcommanded me to give his majesty an account of myself which i did in avery few words and glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door andcould not endure i should be out of her sight being admitted confirmedall that had passed from my arrival at her fathers housethe king although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions hadbeen educated in the study of philosophy and particularly mathematicsyet when he observed my shape exactly and saw me walk erect before ibegan to speak conceived i might be a piece of clockwork which is inthat country arrived to a very great perfection contrived by someingenious artist  but when he heard my voice and found what i deliveredto be regular and rational he could not conceal his astonishment  hewas by no means satisfied with the relation i gave him of the manner icame into his kingdom but thought it a story concerted betweenglumdalclitch and her father who had taught me a set of words to make mesell at a better price  upon this imagination he put several otherquestions to me and still received rational answers no otherwisedefective than by a foreign accent and an imperfect knowledge in thelanguage with some rustic phrases which i had learned at the farmershouse and did not suit the polite style of a courthis majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their weeklywaiting according to the custom in that country  these gentlemen afterthey had a while examined my shape with much nicety were of differentopinions concerning me  they all agreed that i could not be producedaccording to the regular laws of nature because i was not framed with acapacity of preserving my life either by swiftness or climbing oftrees or digging holes in the earth  they observed by my teeth whichthey viewed with great exactness that i was a carnivorous animal yetmost quadrupeds being an overmatch for me and field mice with someothers too nimble they could not imagine how i should be able tosupport myself unless i fed upon snails and other insects which theyoffered by many learned arguments to evince that i could not possiblydo  one of these virtuosi seemed to think that i might be an embryo orabortive birth  but this opinion was rejected by the other two whoobserved my limbs to be perfect and finished and that i had livedseveral years as it was manifest from my beard the stumps whereof theyplainly discovered through a magnifying glass  they would not allow meto be a dwarf because my littleness was beyond all degrees ofcomparison for the queens favourite dwarf the smallest ever known inthat kingdom was near thirty feet high  after much debate theyconcluded unanimously that i was only relplum scalcath which isinterpreted literally lusus natur a determination exactly agreeableto the modern philosophy of europe whose professors disdaining the oldevasion of occult causes whereby the followers of aristotle endeavouredin vain to disguise their ignorance have invented this wonderfulsolution of all difficulties to the unspeakable advancement of humanknowledgeafter this decisive conclusion i entreated to be heard a word or two  iapplied myself to the king and assured his majesty that i came from acountry which abounded with several millions of both sexes and of my ownstature where the animals trees and houses were all in proportionand where by consequence i might be as able to defend myself and tofind sustenance as any of his majestys subjects could do here which itook for a full answer to those gentlemens arguments  to this theyonly replied with a smile of contempt saying that the farmer hadinstructed me very well in my lesson  the king who had a much betterunderstanding dismissing his learned men sent for the farmer who bygood fortune was not yet gone out of town  having therefore firstexamined him privately and then confronted him with me and the younggirl his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly betrue he desired the queen to order that a particular care should betaken of me and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continuein her office of tending me because he observed we had a great affectionfor each other  a convenient apartment was provided for her at courtshe had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education amaid to dress her and two other servants for menial offices but thecare of me was wholly appropriated to herself  the queen commanded herown cabinetmaker to contrive a box that might serve me for abedchamber after the model that glumdalclitch and i should agree uponthis man was a most ingenious artist and according to my direction inthree weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square andtwelve high with sashwindows a door and two closets like a londonbedchamber  the board that made the ceiling was to be lifted up anddown by two hinges to put in a bed ready furnished by her majestysupholsterer which glumdalclitch took out every day to air made it withher own hands and letting it down at night locked up the roof over mea nice workman who was famous for little curiosities undertook to makeme two chairs with backs and frames of a substance not unlike ivoryand two tables with a cabinet to put my things in  the room was quiltedon all sides as well as the floor and the ceiling to prevent anyaccident from the carelessness of those who carried me and to break theforce of a jolt when i went in a coach  i desired a lock for my doorto prevent rats and mice from coming in  the smith after severalattempts made the smallest that ever was seen among them for i haveknown a larger at the gate of a gentlemans house in england  i made ashift to keep the key in a pocket of my own fearing glumdalclitch mightlose it  the queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could begotten to make me clothes not much thicker than an english blanketvery cumbersome till i was accustomed to them  they were after thefashion of the kingdom partly resembling the persian and partly thechinese and are a very grave and decent habitthe queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine withoutme  i had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate just ather left elbow and a chair to sit on  glumdalclitch stood on a stool onthe floor near my table to assist and take care of me  i had an entireset of silver dishes and plates and other necessaries which inproportion to those of the queen were not much bigger than what i haveseen in a london toyshop for the furniture of a babyhouse these mylittle nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box and gave me at meals asi wanted them always cleaning them herself  no person dined with thequeen but the two princesses royal the eldest sixteen years old and theyounger at that time thirteen and a month  her majesty used to put a bitof meat upon one of my dishes out of which i carved for myself and herdiversion was to see me eat in miniature for the queen who had indeedbut a weak stomach took up at one mouthful as much as a dozen englishfarmers could eat at a meal which to me was for some time a verynauseous sight  she would craunch the wing of a lark bones and allbetween her teeth although it were nine times as large as that of afullgrown turkey and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as twotwelvepenny loaves  she drank out of a golden cup above a hogshead ata draught  her knives were twice as long as a scythe set straight uponthe handle  the spoons forks and other instruments were all in thesame proportion  i remember when glumdalclitch carried me out ofcuriosity to see some of the tables at court where ten or a dozen ofthose enormous knives and forks were lifted up together i thought i hadnever till then beheld so terrible a sightit is the custom that every wednesday which as i have observed istheir sabbath the king and queen with the royal issue of both sexesdine together in the apartment of his majesty to whom i was now become agreat favourite and at these times my little chair and table wereplaced at his left hand before one of the saltcellars  this princetook a pleasure in conversing with me inquiring into the mannersreligion laws government and learning of europe wherein i gave himthe best account i was able  his apprehension was so clear and hisjudgment so exact that he made very wise reflections and observationsupon all i said  but i confess that after i had been a little toocopious in talking of my own beloved country of our trade and wars bysea and land of our schisms in religion and parties in the state theprejudices of his education prevailed so far that he could not forbeartaking me up in his right hand and stroking me gently with the otherafter a hearty fit of laughing asked me whether i was a whig or torythen turning to his first minister who waited behind him with a whitestaff near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign he observedhow contemptible a thing was human grandeur which could be mimicked bysuch diminutive insects as i and yet says he i dare engage thesecreatures have their titles and distinctions of honour they contrivelittle nests and burrows that they call houses and cities they make afigure in dress and equipage they love they fight they dispute theycheat they betray  and thus he continued on while my colour came andwent several times with indignation to hear our noble country themistress of arts and arms the scourge of france the arbitress ofeurope the seat of virtue piety honour and truth the pride and envyof the world so contemptuously treatedbut as i was not in a condition to resent injuries so upon maturethoughts i began to doubt whether i was injured or no  for after havingbeen accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this peopleand observed every object upon which i cast mine eyes to be ofproportionable magnitude the horror i had at first conceived from theirbulk and aspect was so far worn off that if i had then beheld a companyof english lords and ladies in their finery and birthday clothes actingtheir several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting and bowingand prating to say the truth i should have been strongly tempted tolaugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me  neitherindeed could i forbear smiling at myself when the queen used to placeme upon her hand towards a lookingglass by which both our personsappeared before me in full view together and there could be nothing moreridiculous than the comparison so that i really began to imagine myselfdwindled many degrees below my usual sizenothing angered and mortified me so much as the queens dwarf who beingof the lowest stature that was ever in that country for i verily thinkhe was not full thirty feet high became so insolent at seeing acreature so much beneath him that he would always affect to swagger andlook big as he passed by me in the queens antechamber while i wasstanding on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court andhe seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness against whichi could only revenge myself by calling him brother challenging him towrestle and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pagesone day at dinner this malicious little cub was so nettled withsomething i had said to him that raising himself upon the frame of hermajestys chair he took me up by the middle as i was sitting down notthinking any harm and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream andthen ran away as fast as he could  i fell over head and ears and if ihad not been a good swimmer it might have gone very hard with me forglumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of theroom and the queen was in such a fright that she wanted presence ofmind to assist me  but my little nurse ran to my relief and took meout after i had swallowed above a quart of cream  i was put to bedhowever i received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clotheswhich was utterly spoiled  the dwarf was soundly whipt and as a fartherpunishment forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrownme neither was he ever restored to favour for soon after the queenbestowed him on a lady of high quality so that i saw him no more to myvery great satisfaction for i could not tell to what extremities such amalicious urchin might have carried his resentmenthe had before served me a scurvy trick which set the queen alaughingalthough at the same time she was heartily vexed and would haveimmediately cashiered him if i had not been so generous as to intercedeher majesty had taken a marrowbone upon her plate and after knockingout the marrow placed the bone again in the dish erect as it stoodbefore the dwarf watching his opportunity while glumdalclitch was goneto the sideboard mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of meat meals took me up in both hands and squeezing my legs togetherwedged them into the marrow bone above my waist where i stuck for sometime and made a very ridiculous figure  i believe it was near a minutebefore any one knew what was become of me for i thought it below me tocry out  but as princes seldom get their meat hot my legs were notscalded only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition  the dwarfat my entreaty had no other punishment than a sound whippingi was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness andshe used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowardsas myself  the occasion was this the kingdom is much pestered withflies in summer and these odious insects each of them as big as adunstable lark hardly gave me any rest while i sat at dinner with theircontinual humming and buzzing about mine ears  they would sometimesalight upon my victuals and leave their loathsome excrement or spawnbehind which to me was very visible though not to the natives of thatcountry whose large optics were not so acute as mine in viewing smallerobjects  sometimes they would fix upon my nose or forehead where theystung me to the quick smelling very offensively and i could easilytrace that viscous matter which our naturalists tell us enables thosecreatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling  i had much adoto defend myself against these detestable animals and could not forbearstarting when they came on my face  it was the common practice of thedwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand as schoolboys doamong us and let them out suddenly under my nose on purpose to frightenme and divert the queen  my remedy was to cut them in pieces with myknife as they flew in the air wherein my dexterity was much admiredi remember one morning when glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon awindow as she usually did in fair days to give me air for i durst notventure to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window as we do withcages in england after i had lifted up one of my sashes and sat downat my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast above twentywasps allured by the smell came flying into the room humming louderthan the drones of as many bagpipes  some of them seized my cake andcarried it piecemeal away others flew about my head and faceconfounding me with the noise and putting me in the utmost terror oftheir stings  however i had the courage to rise and draw my hanger andattack them in the air  i dispatched four of them but the rest gotaway and i presently shut my window  these insects were as large aspartridges i took out their stings found them an inch and a half longand as sharp as needles  i carefully preserved them all and havingsince shown them with some other curiosities in several parts ofeurope upon my return to england i gave three of them to greshamcollege and kept the fourth for myselfchapter ivthe country described  a proposal for correcting modern maps  thekings palace and some account of the metropolis  the authors way oftravelling  the chief temple describedi now intend to give the reader a short description of this country asfar as i travelled in it which was not above two thousand miles roundlorbrulgrud the metropolis  for the queen whom i always attendednever went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses andthere staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers  thewhole extent of this princes dominions reaches about six thousand milesin length and from three to five in breadth whence i cannot butconclude that our geographers of europe are in a great error bysupposing nothing but sea between japan and california for it was evermy opinion that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise thegreat continent of tartary and therefore they ought to correct theirmaps and charts by joining this vast tract of land to the northwestparts of america wherein i shall be ready to lend them my assistancethe kingdom is a peninsula terminated to the northeast by a ridge ofmountains thirty miles high which are altogether impassable by reasonof the volcanoes upon the tops neither do the most learned know whatsort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains or whether they beinhabited at all  on the three other sides it is bounded by the oceanthere is not one seaport in the whole kingdom and those parts of thecoasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed rocks and thesea generally so rough that there is no venturing with the smallest oftheir boats so that these people are wholly excluded from any commercewith the rest of the world  but the large rivers are full of vesselsand abound with excellent fish for they seldom get any from the seabecause the sea fish are of the same size with those in europe andconsequently not worth catching whereby it is manifest that nature inthe production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk iswholly confined to this continent of which i leave the reasons to bedetermined by philosophers  however now and then they take a whale thathappens to be dashed against the rocks which the common people feed onheartily  these whales i have known so large that a man could hardlycarry one upon his shoulders and sometimes for curiosity they arebrought in hampers to lorbrulgrud i saw one of them in a dish at thekings table which passed for a rarity but i did not observe he wasfond of it for i think indeed the bigness disgusted him although ihave seen one somewhat larger in greenlandthe country is well inhabited for it contains fiftyone cities near ahundred walled towns and a great number of villages  to satisfy mycurious reader it may be sufficient to describe lorbrulgrud  this citystands upon almost two equal parts on each side the river that passesthrough  it contains above eighty thousand houses and about six hundredthousand inhabitants  it is in length three glomglungs which makeabout fiftyfour english miles and two and a half in breadth as imeasured it myself in the royal map made by the kings order which waslaid on the ground on purpose for me and extended a hundred feet ipaced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot andcomputing by the scale measured it pretty exactlythe kings palace is no regular edifice but a heap of buildings aboutseven miles round the chief rooms are generally two hundred and fortyfeet high and broad and long in proportion  a coach was allowed toglumdalclitch and me wherein her governess frequently took her out tosee the town or go among the shops and i was always of the partycarried in my box although the girl at my own desire would often takeme out and hold me in her hand that i might more conveniently view thehouses and the people as we passed along the streets  i reckoned ourcoach to be about a square of westminsterhall but not altogether sohigh however i cannot be very exact  one day the governess ordered ourcoachman to stop at several shops where the beggars watching theiropportunity crowded to the sides of the coach and gave me the mosthorrible spectacle that ever a european eye beheld  there was a womanwith a cancer in her breast swelled to a monstrous size full of holesin two or three of which i could have easily crept and covered my wholebody  there was a fellow with a wen in his neck larger than fivewoolpacks and another with a couple of wooden legs each about twentyfeet high  but the most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling ontheir clothes  i could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with mynaked eye much better than those of a european louse through amicroscope and their snouts with which they rooted like swine  theywere the first i had ever beheld and i should have been curious enoughto dissect one of them if i had had proper instruments which iunluckily left behind me in the ship although indeed the sight was sonauseous that it perfectly turned my stomachbesides the large box in which i was usually carried the queen ordered asmaller one to be made for me of about twelve feet square and ten highfor the convenience of travelling because the other was somewhat toolarge for glumdalclitchs lap and cumbersome in the coach it was madeby the same artist whom i directed in the whole contrivance  thistravellingcloset was an exact square with a window in the middle ofthree of the squares and each window was latticed with iron wire on theoutside to prevent accidents in long journeys  on the fourth sidewhich had no window two strong staples were fixed through which theperson that carried me when i had a mind to be on horseback put aleathern belt and buckled it about his waist  this was always theoffice of some grave trusty servant in whom i could confide whether iattended the king and queen in their progresses or were disposed to seethe gardens or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state inthe court when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order for i soonbegan to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers i supposemore upon account of their majesties favour than any merit of my ownin journeys when i was weary of the coach a servant on horseback wouldbuckle on my box and place it upon a cushion before him and there i hada full prospect of the country on three sides from my three windows  ihad in this closet a fieldbed and a hammock hung from the ceilingtwo chairs and a table neatly screwed to the floor to prevent beingtossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach  and having beenlong used to seavoyages those motions although sometimes very violentdid not much discompose mewhenever i had a mind to see the town it was always in mytravellingcloset which glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of opensedan after the fashion of the country borne by four men and attendedby two others in the queens livery  the people who had often heard ofme were very curious to crowd about the sedan and the girl wascomplaisant enough to make the bearers stop and to take me in her handthat i might be more conveniently seeni was very desirous to see the chief temple and particularly the towerbelonging to it which is reckoned the highest in the kingdomaccordingly one day my nurse carried me thither but i may truly say icame back disappointed for the height is not above three thousand feetreckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top which allowingfor the difference between the size of those people and us in europe isno great matter for admiration nor at all equal in proportion if irightly remember to salisbury steeple  but not to detract from anation to which during my life i shall acknowledge myself extremelyobliged it must be allowed that whatever this famous tower wants inheight is amply made up in beauty and strength for the walls are near ahundred feet thick built of hewn stone whereof each is about forty feetsquare and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors cutin marble larger than the life placed in their several niches  imeasured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statuesand lay unperceived among some rubbish and found it exactly four feetand an inch in length  glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchiefand carried it home in her pocket to keep among other trinkets of whichthe girl was very fond as children at her age usually arethe kings kitchen is indeed a noble building vaulted at top and aboutsix hundred feet high  the great oven is not so wide by ten paces asthe cupola at st pauls for i measured the latter on purpose after myreturn  but if i should describe the kitchen grate the prodigious potsand kettles the joints of meat turning on the spits with many otherparticulars perhaps i should be hardly believed at least a severecritic would be apt to think i enlarged a little as travellers are oftensuspected to do  to avoid which censure i fear i have run too much intothe other extreme and that if this treatise should happen to betranslated into the language of brobdingnag which is the general name ofthat kingdom and transmitted thither the king and his people wouldhave reason to complain that i had done them an injury by a false anddiminutive representationhis majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables theyare generally from fiftyfour to sixty feet high  but when he goesabroad on solemn days he is attended for state by a military guard offive hundred horse which indeed i thought was the most splendid sightthat could be ever beheld till i saw part of his army in battaliawhereof i shall find another occasion to speakchapter vseveral adventurers that happened to the author  the execution of acriminal  the author shows his skill in navigationi should have lived happy enough in that country if my littleness hadnot exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents some ofwhich i shall venture to relate  glumdalclitch often carried me into thegardens of the court in my smaller box and would sometimes take me outof it and hold me in her hand or set me down to walk  i rememberbefore the dwarf left the queen he followed us one day into thosegardens and my nurse having set me down he and i being close togethernear some dwarf apple trees i must needs show my wit by a sillyallusion between him and the trees which happens to hold in theirlanguage as it does in ours  whereupon the malicious rogue watchinghis opportunity when i was walking under one of them shook it directlyover my head by which a dozen apples each of them near as large as abristol barrel came tumbling about my ears one of them hit me on theback as i chanced to stoop and knocked me down flat on my face but ireceived no other hurt and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire becausei had given the provocationanother day glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grassplot to divertmyself while she walked at some distance with her governess  in themeantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail that i wasimmediately by the force of it struck to the ground and when i wasdown the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body as if ihad been pelted with tennisballs however i made a shift to creep onall fours and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the leesideof a border of lemonthyme but so bruised from head to foot that icould not go abroad in ten days  neither is this at all to be wonderedat because nature in that country observing the same proportionthrough all her operations a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times aslarge as one in europe which i can assert upon experience having beenso curious as to weigh and measure thembut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden when mylittle nurse believing she had put me in a secure place which i oftenentreated her to do that i might enjoy my own thoughts and having leftmy box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it went to another partof the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintancewhile she was absent and out of hearing a small white spaniel thatbelonged to one of the chief gardeners having got by accident into thegarden happened to range near the place where i lay the dog followingthe scent came directly up and taking me in his mouth ran straight tohis master wagging his tail and set me gently on the ground  by goodfortune he had been so well taught that i was carried between his teethwithout the least hurt or even tearing my clothes  but the poorgardener who knew me well and had a great kindness for me was in aterrible fright he gently took me up in both his hands and asked me howi did but i was so amazed and out of breath that i could not speak aword  in a few minutes i came to myself and he carried me safe to mylittle nurse who by this time had returned to the place where she leftme and was in cruel agonies when i did not appear nor answer when shecalled  she severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dogbut the thing was hushed up and never known at court for the girl wasafraid of the queens anger and truly as to myself i thought it wouldnot be for my reputation that such a story should go aboutthis accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust meabroad for the future out of her sight  i had been long afraid of thisresolution and therefore concealed from her some little unluckyadventures that happened in those times when i was left by myself  oncea kite hovering over the garden made a stoop at me and if i had notresolutely drawn my hanger and run under a thick espalier he would havecertainly carried me away in his talons  another time walking to thetop of a fresh molehill i fell to my neck in the hole through whichthat animal had cast up the earth and coined some lie not worthremembering to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes  i likewise brokemy right shin against the shell of a snail which i happened to stumbleover as i was walking alone and thinking on poor englandi cannot tell whether i were more pleased or mortified to observe inthose solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at allafraid of me but would hop about within a yards distance looking forworms and other food with as much indifference and security as if nocreature at all were near them  i remember a thrush had the confidenceto snatch out of my hand with his bill a of cake that glumdalclitch hadjust given me for my breakfast  when i attempted to catch any of thesebirds they would boldly turn against me endeavouring to peck myfingers which i durst not venture within their reach and then theywould hop back unconcerned to hunt for worms or snails as they didbefore  but one day i took a thick cudgel and threw it with all mystrength so luckily at a linnet that i knocked him down and seizinghim by the neck with both my hands ran with him in triumph to my nursehowever the bird who had only been stunned recovering himself gave meso many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body though iheld him at armslength and was out of the reach of his claws that iwas twenty times thinking to let him go  but i was soon relieved by oneof our servants who wrung off the birds neck and i had him next dayfor dinner by the queens command  this linnet as near as i canremember seemed to be somewhat larger than an english swanthe maids of honour often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments anddesired she would bring me along with her on purpose to have thepleasure of seeing and touching me  they would often strip me naked fromtop to toe and lay me at full length in their bosoms wherewith i wasmuch disgusted because to say the truth a very offensive smell camefrom their skins which i do not mention or intend to the disadvantageof those excellent ladies for whom i have all manner of respect but iconceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness andthat those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their loversor to each other than people of the same quality are with us in englandand after all i found their natural smell was much more supportablethan when they used perfumes under which i immediately swooned away  icannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in lilliput took thefreedom in a warm day when i had used a good deal of exercise tocomplain of a strong smell about me although i am as little faulty thatway as most of my sex but i suppose his faculty of smelling was as nicewith regard to me as mine was to that of this people  upon this pointi cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress andglumdalclitch my nurse whose persons were as sweet as those of any ladyin englandthat which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour when mynurse carried me to visit then was to see them use me without anymanner of ceremony like a creature who had no sort of consequence forthey would strip themselves to the skin and put on their smocks in mypresence while i was placed on their toilet directly before their nakedbodies which i am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sightor from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgusttheir skins appeared so coarse and uneven so variously coloured when isaw them near with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher andhairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads to say nothing fartherconcerning the rest of their persons  neither did they at all scruplewhile i was by to discharge what they had drank to the quantity of atleast two hogsheads in a vessel that held above three tuns  thehandsomest among these maids of honour a pleasant frolicsome girl ofsixteen would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples withmany other tricks wherein the reader will excuse me for not being overparticular  but i was so much displeased that i entreated glumdalclitchto contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any moreone day a young gentleman who was nephew to my nurses governess cameand pressed them both to see an execution  it was of a man who hadmurdered one of that gentlemans intimate acquaintance  glumdalclitchwas prevailed on to be of the company very much against her inclinationfor she was naturally tenderhearted and as for myself although iabhorred such kind of spectacles yet my curiosity tempted me to seesomething that i thought must be extraordinary  the malefactor was fixedin a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose and his head cut offat one blow with a sword of about forty feet long  the veins andarteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood and so high inthe air that the great jet deau at versailles was not equal to it forthe time it lasted and the head when it fell on the scaffold floorgave such a bounce as made me start although i was at least half anenglish mile distantthe queen who often used to hear me talk of my seavoyages and took alloccasions to divert me when i was melancholy asked me whether iunderstood how to handle a sail or an oar and whether a little exerciseof rowing might not be convenient for my health  i answered that iunderstood both very well for although my proper employment had been tobe surgeon or doctor to the ship yet often upon a pinch i was forcedto work like a common mariner  but i could not see how this could bedone in their country where the smallest wherry was equal to afirstrate man of war among us and such a boat as i could manage wouldnever live in any of their rivers  her majesty said if i would contrivea boat her own joiner should make it and she would provide a place forme to sail in  the fellow was an ingenious workman and by myinstructions in ten days finished a pleasureboat with all itstackling able conveniently to hold eight europeans  when it wasfinished the queen was so delighted that she ran with it in her lap tothe king who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water with mein it by way of trial where i could not manage my two sculls or littleoars for want of room  but the queen had before contrived anotherproject  she ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundredfeet long fifty broad and eight deep which being well pitched toprevent leaking was placed on the floor along the wall in an outerroom of the palace  it had a cock near the bottom to let out the waterwhen it began to grow stale and two servants could easily fill it inhalf an hour  here i often used to row for my own diversion as well asthat of the queen and her ladies who thought themselves well entertainedwith my skill and agility  sometimes i would put up my sail and then mybusiness was only to steer while the ladies gave me a gale with theirfans and when they were weary some of their pages would blow my sailforward with their breath while i showed my art by steering starboard orlarboard as i pleased  when i had done glumdalclitch always carriedback my boat into her closet and hung it on a nail to dryin this exercise i once met an accident which had like to have cost memy life for one of the pages having put my boat into the trough thegoverness who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up toplace me in the boat but i happened to slip through her fingers andshould infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor if by theluckiest chance in the world i had not been stopped by a corkingpinthat stuck in the good gentlewomans stomacher the head of the pinpassing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches and thus i washeld by the middle in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my reliefanother time one of the servants whose office it was to fill my troughevery third day with fresh water was so careless as to let a huge frognot perceiving it slip out of his pail  the frog lay concealed till iwas put into my boat but then seeing a restingplace climbed up andmade it lean so much on one side that i was forced to balance it withall my weight on the other to prevent overturning  when the frog wasgot in it hopped at once half the length of the boat and then over myhead backward and forward daubing my face and clothes with its odiousslime  the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformedanimal that can be conceived  however i desired glumdalclitch to let medeal with it alone  i banged it a good while with one of my sculls andat last forced it to leap out of the boatbut the greatest danger i ever underwent in that kingdom was from amonkey who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen  glumdalclitchhad locked me up in her closet while she went somewhere upon businessor a visit  the weather being very warm the closetwindow was leftopen as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box in which iusually lived because of its largeness and conveniency  as i satquietly meditating at my table i heard something bounce in at theclosetwindow and skip about from one side to the other whereatalthough i was much alarmed yet i ventured to look out but not stirringfrom my seat and then i saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leapingup and down till at last he came to my box which he seemed to view withgreat pleasure and curiosity peeping in at the door and every window  iretreated to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkeylooking in at every side put me in such a fright that i wanted presenceof mind to conceal myself under the bed as i might easily have doneafter some time spent in peeping grinning and chattering he at lastespied me and reaching one of his paws in at the door as a cat doeswhen she plays with a mouse although i often shifted place to avoid himhe at length seized the lappet of my coat which being made of thatcountry silk was very thick and strong and dragged me out  he took meup in his right forefoot and held me as a nurse does a child she isgoing to suckle just as i have seen the same sort of creature do with akitten in europe and when i offered to struggle he squeezed me so hardthat i thought it more prudent to submit  i have good reason to believethat he took me for a young one of his own species by his often strokingmy face very gently with his other paw  in these diversions he wasinterrupted by a noise at the closet door as if somebody were openingit whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had comein and thence upon the leads and gutters walking upon three legs andholding me in the fourth till he clambered up to a roof that was next toours  i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carryingme out  the poor girl was almost distracted that quarter of the palacewas all in an uproar the servants ran for ladders the monkey was seenby hundreds in the court sitting upon the ridge of a building holdingme like a baby in one of his forepaws and feeding me with the other bycramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag onone side of his chaps and patting me when i would not eat whereat manyof the rabble below could not forbear laughing neither do i think theyjustly ought to be blamed for without question the sight wasridiculous enough to every body but myself  some of the people threw upstones hoping to drive the monkey down but this was strictly forbiddenor else very probably my brains had been dashed outthe ladders were now applied and mounted by several men which themonkey observing and finding himself almost encompassed not being ableto make speed enough with his three legs let me drop on a ridge tileand made his escape  here i sat for some time five hundred yards fromthe ground expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind or tofall by my own giddiness and come tumbling over and over from the ridgeto the eaves but an honest lad one of my nurses footmen climbed upand putting me into his breeches pocket brought me down safei was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down mythroat but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a smallneedle and then i fell avomiting which gave me great relief  yet iwas so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by thisodious animal that i was forced to keep my bed a fortnight  the kingqueen and all the court sent every day to inquire after my health andher majesty made me several visits during my sickness  the monkey waskilled and an order made that no such animal should be kept about thepalacewhen i attended the king after my recovery to return him thanks for hisfavours he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure  heasked me what my thoughts and speculations were while i lay in themonkeys paw how i liked the victuals he gave me his manner of feedingand whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach  hedesired to know what i would have done upon such an occasion in my owncountry  i told his majesty that in europe we had no monkeys exceptsuch as were brought for curiosity from other places and so small thati could deal with a dozen of them together if they presumed to attackme  and as for that monstrous animal with whom i was so lately engagedit was indeed as large as an elephant if my fears had suffered me tothink so far as to make use of my hanger looking fiercely andclapping my hand on the hilt as i spoke when he poked his paw into mychamber perhaps i should have given him such a wound as would have madehim glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in  this idelivered in a firm tone like a person who was jealous lest his courageshould be called in question  however my speech produced nothing elsebeside a laud laughter which all the respect due to his majesty fromthose about him could not make them contain  this made me reflect howvain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour amongthose who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him  andyet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in englandsince my return where a little contemptible varlet without the leasttitle to birth person wit or common sense shall presume to look withimportance and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of thekingdomi was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story andglumdalclitch although she loved me to excess yet was arch enough toinform the queen whenever i committed any folly that she thought wouldbe diverting to her majesty  the girl who had been out of order wascarried by her governess to take the air about an hours distance orthirty miles from town  they alighted out of the coach near a smallfootpath in a field and glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box iwent out of it to walk  there was a cowdung in the path and i mustneed try my activity by attempting to leap over it  i took a run butunfortunately jumped short and found myself just in the middle up to myknees  i waded through with some difficulty and one of the footmenwiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief for i was filthilybemired and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned home wherethe queen was soon informed of what had passed and the footmen spread itabout the court so that all the mirth for some days was at my expensechapter viseveral contrivances of the author to please the king and queen  heshows his skill in music  the king inquires into the state of englandwhich the author relates to him  the kings observations thereoni used to attend the kings levee once or twice a week and had oftenseen him under the barbers hand which indeed was at first very terribleto behold for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythehis majesty according to the custom of the country was only shavedtwice aweek  i once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the sudsor lather out of which i picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumpsof hair  i then took a piece of fine wood and cut it like the back of acomb making several holes in it at equal distances with as small aneedle as i could get from glumdalclitch  i fixed in the stumps soartificially scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the pointsthat i made a very tolerable comb which was a seasonable supply my ownbeing so much broken in the teeth that it was almost useless neitherdid i know any artist in that country so nice and exact as wouldundertake to make me anotherand this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein i spent many of myleisure hours  i desired the queens woman to save for me the combingsof her majestys hair whereof in time i got a good quantity andconsulting with my friend the cabinetmaker who had received generalorders to do little jobs for me i directed him to make two chairframesno larger than those i had in my box and to bore little holes with afine awl round those parts where i designed the backs and seats throughthese holes i wove the strongest hairs i could pick out just after themanner of cane chairs in england  when they were finished i made apresent of them to her majesty who kept them in her cabinet and used toshow them for curiosities as indeed they were the wonder of every onethat beheld them  the queen would have me sit upon one of these chairsbut i absolutely refused to obey her protesting i would rather die thanplace a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs that onceadorned her majestys head  of these hairs as i had always a mechanicalgenius i likewise made a neat little purse about five feet long withher majestys name deciphered in gold letters which i gave toglumdalclitch by the queens consent  to say the truth it was more forshow than use being not of strength to bear the weight of the largercoins and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys thatgirls are fond ofthe king who delighted in music had frequent concerts at court towhich i was sometimes carried and set in my box on a table to hear thembut the noise was so great that i could hardly distinguish the tunes  iam confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army beating andsounding together just at your ears could not equal it  my practice wasto have my box removed from the place where the performers sat as far asi could then to shut the doors and windows of it and draw the windowcurtains after which i found their music not disagreeablei had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinetglumdalclitch kept one in her chamber and a master attended twice aweekto teach her i called it a spinet because it somewhat resembled thatinstrument and was played upon in the same manner  a fancy came into myhead that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune uponthis instrument  but this appeared extremely difficult for the spinetwas near sixty feet long each key being almost a foot wide so that withmy arms extended i could not reach to above five keys and to press themdown required a good smart stroke with my fist which would be too greata labour and to no purpose  the method i contrived was this i preparedtwo round sticks about the bigness of common cudgels they were thickerat one end than the other and i covered the thicker ends with pieces ofa mouses skin that by rapping on them i might neither damage the topsof the keys nor interrupt the sound  before the spinet a bench wasplaced about four feet below the keys and i was put upon the bench  iran sideling upon it that way and this as fast as i could banging theproper keys with my two sticks and made a shift to play a jig to thegreat satisfaction of both their majesties but it was the most violentexercise i ever underwent and yet i could not strike above sixteen keysnor consequently play the bass and treble together as other artists dowhich was a great disadvantage to my performancethe king who as i before observed was a prince of excellentunderstanding would frequently order that i should be brought in my boxand set upon the table in his closet he would then command me to bringone of my chairs out of the box and sit down within three yards distanceupon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to a level with hisface  in this manner i had several conversations with him  i one daytook the freedom to tell his majesty that the contempt he discoveredtowards europe and the rest of the world did not seem answerable tothose excellent qualities of mind that he was master of that reason didnot extend itself with the bulk of the body on the contrary we observedin our country that the tallest persons were usually the least providedwith it that among other animals bees and ants had the reputation ofmore industry art and sagacity than many of the larger kinds andthat as inconsiderable as he took me to be i hoped i might live to dohis majesty some signal service  the king heard me with attention andbegan to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever beforehe desired i would give him as exact an account of the government ofengland as i possibly could because as fond as princes commonly are oftheir own customs for so he conjectured of other monarchs by my formerdiscourses he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserveimitationimagine with thyself courteous reader how often i then wished for thetongue of demosthenes or cicero that might have enabled me to celebratethe praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its meritsand felicityi began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominionsconsisted of two islands which composed three mighty kingdoms under onesovereign beside our plantations in america  i dwelt long upon thefertility of our soil and the temperature of our climate  i then spokeat large upon the constitution of an english parliament partly made upof an illustrious body called the house of peers persons of the noblestblood and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies  i described thatextraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms toqualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom to havea share in the legislature to be members of the highest court ofjudicature whence there can be no appeal and to be champions alwaysready for the defence of their prince and country by their valourconduct and fidelity  that these were the ornament and bulwark of thekingdom worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors whose honourhad been the reward of their virtue from which their posterity werenever once known to degenerate  to these were joined several holypersons as part of that assembly under the title of bishops whosepeculiar business is to take care of religion and of those who instructthe people therein  these were searched and sought out through the wholenation by the prince and his wisest counsellors among such of thepriesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of theirlives and the depth of their erudition who were indeed the spiritualfathers of the clergy and the peoplethat the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called thehouse of commons who were all principal gentlemen freely picked andculled out by the people themselves for their great abilities and loveof their country to represent the wisdom of the whole nation  and thatthese two bodies made up the most august assembly in europe to whom inconjunction with the prince the whole legislature is committedi then descended to the courts of justice over which the judges thosevenerable sages and interpreters of the law presided for determiningthe disputed rights and properties of men as well as for the punishmentof vice and protection of innocence  i mentioned the prudent managementof our treasury the valour and achievements of our forces by sea andland  i computed the number of our people by reckoning how manymillions there might be of each religious sect or political party amongus  i did not omit even our sports and pastimes or any other particularwhich i thought might redound to the honour of my country  and ifinished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events inengland for about a hundred years pastthis conversation was not ended under five audiences each of severalhours and the king heard the whole with great attention frequentlytaking notes of what i spoke as well as memorandums of what questions heintended to ask mewhen i had put an end to these long discources his majesty in a sixthaudience consulting his notes proposed many doubts queries andobjections upon every article  he asked what methods were used tocultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility and in what kind ofbusiness they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of theirlives  what course was taken to supply that assembly when any noblefamily became extinct  what qualifications were necessary in those whoare to be created new lords whether the humour of the prince a sum ofmoney to a court lady or a design of strengthening a party opposite tothe public interest ever happened to be the motive in thoseadvancements  what share of knowledge these lords had in the laws oftheir country and how they came by it so as to enable them to decidethe properties of their fellowsubjects in the last resort  whether theywere always so free from avarice partialities or want that a bribe orsome other sinister view could have no place among them  whether thoseholy lords i spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account oftheir knowledge in religious matters and the sanctity of their liveshad never been compliers with the times while they were common priestsor slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman whose opinions theycontinued servilely to follow after they were admitted into thatassemblyhe then desired to know what arts were practised in electing those whomi called commoners whether a stranger with a strong purse might notinfluence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord orthe most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood  how it came topass that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assemblywhich i allowed to be a great trouble and expense often to the ruin oftheir families without any salary or pension because this appeared suchan exalted strain of virtue and public spirit that his majesty seemed todoubt it might possibly not be always sincere  and he desired to knowwhether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refundingthemselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing thepublic good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunctionwith a corrupted ministry  he multiplied his questions and sifted methoroughly upon every part of this head proposing numberless inquiriesand objections which i think it not prudent or convenient to repeatupon what i said in relation to our courts of justice his majestydesired to be satisfied in several points and this i was the better ableto do having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancerywhich was decreed for me with costs  he asked what time was usuallyspent in determining between right and wrong and what degree of expensewhether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestlyknown to be unjust vexatious or oppressive  whether party in religionor politics were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justicewhether those pleading orators were persons educated in the generalknowledge of equity or only in provincial national and other localcustoms  whether they or their judges had any part in penning thoselaws which they assumed the liberty of interpreting and glossing uponat their pleasure  whether they had ever at different times pleadedfor and against the same cause and cited precedents to prove contraryopinions  whether they were a rich or a poor corporation  whether theyreceived any pecuniary reward for pleading or delivering their opinionsand particularly whether they were ever admitted as members in the lowersenatehe fell next upon the management of our treasury and said he thoughtmy memory had failed me because i computed our taxes at about five orsix millions ayear and when i came to mention the issues he found theysometimes amounted to more than double for the notes he had taken werevery particular in this point because he hoped as he told me that theknowledge of our conduct might be useful to him and he could not bedeceived in his calculations  but if what i told him were true he wasstill at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate like a privateperson  he asked me who were our creditors and where we found moneyto pay them  he wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable andexpensive wars that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people or liveamong very bad neighbours and that our generals must needs be richerthan our kings  he asked what business we had out of our own islandsunless upon the score of trade or treaty or to defend the coasts withour fleet  above all he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenarystanding army in the midst of peace and among a free people  he saidif we were governed by our own consent in the persons of ourrepresentatives he could not imagine of whom we were afraid or againstwhom we were to fight and would hear my opinion whether a private manshouse might not be better defended by himself his children and familythan by halfadozen rascals picked up at a venture in the streets forsmall wages who might get a hundred times more by cutting theirthroatshe laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic as he was pleased to call itin reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from theseveral sects among us in religion and politics  he said he knew noreason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the publicshould be obliged to change or should not be obliged to conceal themand as it was tyranny in any government to require the first so it wasweakness not to enforce the second for a man may be allowed to keeppoisons in his closet but not to vend them about for cordialshe observed that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry i hadmentioned gaming he desired to know at what age this entertainment wasusually taken up and when it was laid down how much of their time itemployed whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortuneswhether mean vicious people by their dexterity in that art might notarrive at great riches and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependenceas well as habituate them to vile companions wholly take them from theimprovement of their minds and force them by the losses they receivedto learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon othershe was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of ouraffairs during the last century protesting it was only a heap ofconspiracies rebellions murders massacres revolutions banishmentsthe very worst effects that avarice faction hypocrisy perfidiousnesscruelty rage madness hatred envy lust malice and ambition couldproducehis majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate thesum of all i had spoken compared the questions he made with the answersi had given then taking me into his hands and stroking me gentlydelivered himself in these words which i shall never forget nor themanner he spoke them in my little friend grildrig you have made a mostadmirable panegyric upon your country you have clearly proved thatignorance idleness and vice are the proper ingredients for qualifyinga legislator that laws are best explained interpreted and applied bythose whose interest and abilities lie in perverting confounding andeluding them  i observe among you some lines of an institution whichin its original might have been tolerable but these half erased andthe rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions  it does not appearfrom all you have said how any one perfection is required toward theprocurement of any one station among you much less that men areennobled on account of their virtue that priests are advanced for theirpiety or learning soldiers for their conduct or valour judges fortheir integrity senators for the love of their country or counsellorsfor their wisdom  as for yourself continued the king who have spentthe greatest part of your life in travelling i am well disposed to hopeyou may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country  but by what ihave gathered from your own relation and the answers i have with muchpains wrung and extorted from you i cannot but conclude the bulk of yournatives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin thatnature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earthchapter viithe authors love of his country  he makes a proposal of much advantageto the king which is rejected  the kings great ignorance in politicsthe learning of that country very imperfect and confined  the laws andmilitary affairs and parties in the statenothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me fromconcealing this part of my story  it was in vain to discover myresentments which were always turned into ridicule and i was forced torest with patience while my noble and beloved country was so injuriouslytreated  i am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly bethat such an occasion was given but this prince happened to be socurious and inquisitive upon every particular that it could not consisteither with gratitude or good manners to refuse giving him whatsatisfaction i was able  yet thus much i may be allowed to say in my ownvindication that i artfully eluded many of his questions and gave toevery point a more favourable turn by many degrees than the strictnessof truth would allow  for i have always borne that laudable partialityto my own country which dionysius halicarnassensis with so muchjustice recommends to an historian i would hide the frailties anddeformities of my political mother and place her virtues and beauties inthe most advantageous light  this was my sincere endeavour in those manydiscourses i had with that monarch although it unfortunately failed ofsuccessbut great allowances should be given to a king who lives wholly secludedfrom the rest of the world and must therefore be altogether unacquaintedwith the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations the wantof which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices and a certainnarrowness of thinking from which we and the politer countries ofeurope are wholly exempted  and it would be hard indeed if so remote aprinces notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard forall mankindto confirm what i have now said and further to show the miserableeffects of a confined education i shall here insert a passage whichwill hardly obtain belief  in hopes to ingratiate myself further intohis majestys favour i told him of an invention discovered betweenthree and four hundred years ago to make a certain powder into a heapof which the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in amoment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up inthe air together with a noise and agitation greater than thunder  thata proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass oriron according to its bigness would drive a ball of iron or lead withsuch violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force  thatthe largest balls thus discharged would not only destroy whole ranks ofan army at once but batter the strongest walls to the ground sink downships with a thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea and whenlinked together by a chain would cut through masts and rigging dividehundreds of bodies in the middle and lay all waste before them  that weoften put this powder into large hollow balls of iron and dischargedthem by an engine into some city we were besieging which would rip upthe pavements tear the houses to pieces burst and throw splinters onevery side dashing out the brains of all who came near  that i knew theingredients very well which were cheap and common i understood themanner of compounding them and could direct his workmen how to makethose tubes of a size proportionable to all other things in hismajestys kingdom and the largest need not be above a hundred feet longtwenty or thirty of which tubes charged with the proper quantity ofpowder and balls would batter down the walls of the strongest town inhis dominions in a few hours or destroy the whole metropolis if ever itshould pretend to dispute his absolute commands  this i humbly offeredto his majesty as a small tribute of acknowledgment in turn for so manymarks that i had received of his royal favour and protectionthe king was struck with horror at the description i had given of thoseterrible engines and the proposal i had made  he was amazed how soimpotent and grovelling an insect as i these were his expressionscould entertain such inhuman ideas and in so familiar a manner as toappear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which ihad painted as the common effects of those destructive machineswhereof he said some evil genius enemy to mankind must have beenthe first contriver  as for himself he protested that although fewthings delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature yethe would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such a secretwhich he commanded me as i valued any life never to mention any morea strange effect of narrow principles and views that a prince possessedof every quality which procures veneration love and esteem of strongparts great wisdom and profound learning endowed with admirabletalents and almost adored by his subjects should from a niceunnecessary scruple whereof in europe we can have no conception letslip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolutemaster of the lives the liberties and the fortunes of his peopleneither do i say this with the least intention to detract from the manyvirtues of that excellent king whose character i am sensible will onthis account be very much lessened in the opinion of an english readerbut i take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance bynot having hitherto reduced politics into a science as the more acutewits of europe have done  for i remember very well in a discourse oneday with the king when i happened to say there were several thousandbooks among us written upon the art of government it gave him directlycontrary to my intention a very mean opinion of our understandings  heprofessed both to abominate and despise all mystery refinement andintrigue either in a prince or a minister  he could not tell what imeant by secrets of state where an enemy or some rival nation were notin the case  he confined the knowledge of governing within very narrowbounds to common sense and reason to justice and lenity to the speedydetermination of civil and criminal causes with some other obvioustopics which are not worth considering  and he gave it for his opinionthat whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass togrow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deservebetter of mankind and do more essential service to his country than thewhole race of politicians put togetherthe learning of this people is very defective consisting only inmorality history poetry and mathematics wherein they must be allowedto excel  but the last of these is wholly applied to what may be usefulin life to the improvement of agriculture and all mechanical arts sothat among us it would be little esteemed  and as to ideas entitiesabstractions and transcendentals i could never drive the leastconception into their headsno law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters intheir alphabet which consists only of two and twenty  but indeed few ofthem extend even to that length  they are expressed in the most plainand simple terms wherein those people are not mercurial enough todiscover above one interpretation and to write a comment upon any lawis a capital crime  as to the decision of civil causes or proceedingsagainst criminals their precedents are so few that they have littlereason to boast of any extraordinary skill in eitherthey have had the art of printing as well as the chinese time out ofmind but their libraries are not very large for that of the king whichis reckoned the largest does not amount to above a thousand volumesplaced in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long whence i had liberty toborrow what books i pleased  the queens joiner had contrived in one ofglumdalclitchs rooms a kind of wooden machine fiveandtwenty feethigh formed like a standing ladder the steps were each fifty feet longit was indeed a moveable pair of stairs the lowest end placed at tenfeet distance from the wall of the chamber  the book i had a mind toread was put up leaning against the wall i first mounted to the upperstep of the ladder and turning my face towards the book began at thetop of the page and so walking to the right and left about eight or tenpaces according to the length of the lines till i had gotten a littlebelow the level of mine eyes and then descending gradually till i cameto the bottom after which i mounted again and began the other page inthe same manner and so turned over the leaf which i could easily dowith both my hands for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard and inthe largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet longtheir style is clear masculine and smooth but not florid for theyavoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words or using variousexpressions  i have perused many of their books especially those inhistory and morality  among the rest i was much diverted with a littleold treatise which always lay in glumdalclitchs bed chamber andbelonged to her governess a grave elderly gentlewoman who dealt inwritings of morality and devotion  the book treats of the weakness ofhuman kind and is in little esteem except among the women and thevulgar  however i was curious to see what an author of that countrycould say upon such a subject  this writer went through all the usualtopics of european moralists showing how diminutive contemptible andhelpless an animal was man in his own nature how unable to defendhimself from inclemencies of the air or the fury of wild beasts howmuch he was excelled by one creature in strength by another in speed bya third in foresight by a fourth in industry  he added that naturewas degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world and couldnow produce only small abortive births in comparison of those in ancienttimes  he said it was very reasonable to think not only that thespecies of men were originally much larger but also that there must havebeen giants in former ages which as it is asserted by history andtradition so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casuallydug up in several parts of the kingdom far exceeding the common dwindledrace of men in our days  he argued that the very laws of natureabsolutely required we should have been made in the beginning of a sizemore large and robust not so liable to destruction from every littleaccident of a tile falling from a house or a stone cast from the handof a boy or being drowned in a little brook  from this way ofreasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in theconduct of life but needless here to repeat  for my own part i couldnot avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread of drawinglectures in morality or indeed rather matter of discontent and repiningfrom the quarrels we raise with nature  and i believe upon a strictinquiry those quarrels might be shown as illgrounded among us as theyare among that peopleas to their military affairs they boast that the kings army consists ofa hundred and seventysix thousand foot and thirtytwo thousand horseif that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in theseveral cities and farmers in the country whose commanders are only thenobility and gentry without pay or reward  they are indeed perfectenough in their exercises and under very good discipline wherein i sawno great merit for how should it be otherwise where every farmer isunder the command of his own landlord and every citizen under that ofthe principal men in his own city chosen after the manner of venice byballoti have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise in agreat field near the city of twenty miles square  they were in all notabove twentyfive thousand foot and six thousand horse but it wasimpossible for me to compute their number considering the space ofground they took up  a cavalier mounted on a large steed might beabout ninety feet high  i have seen this whole body of horse upon aword of command draw their swords at once and brandish them in the airimagination can figure nothing so grand so surprising and soastonishing it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning weredarting at the same time from every quarter of the skyi was curious to know how this prince to whose dominions there is noaccess from any other country came to think of armies or to teach hispeople the practice of military discipline  but i was soon informedboth by conversation and reading their histories for in the course ofmany ages they have been troubled with the same disease to which thewhole race of mankind is subject the nobility often contending forpower the people for liberty and the king for absolute dominion  allwhich however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom have beensometimes violated by each of the three parties and have more than onceoccasioned civil wars the last whereof was happily put an end to by thisprinces grandfather in a general composition and the militia thensettled with common consent has been ever since kept in the strictestdutychapter viiithe king and queen make a progress to the frontiers  the author attendsthem  the manner in which he leaves the country very particularlyrelated  he returns to englandi had always a strong impulse that i should some time recover my libertythough it was impossible to conjecture by what means or to form anyproject with the least hope of succeeding  the ship in which i sailedwas the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast and theking had given strict orders that if at any time another appeared itshould be taken ashore and with all its crew and passengers brought in atumbril to lorbrulgrud  he was strongly bent to get me a woman of my ownsize by whom i might propagate the breed but i think i should ratherhave died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be keptin cages like tame canarybirds and perhaps in time sold about thekingdom to persons of quality for curiosities  i was indeed treatedwith much kindness i was the favourite of a great king and queen andthe delight of the whole court but it was upon such a foot as ill becamethe dignity of humankind  i could never forget those domestic pledges ihad left behind me  i wanted to be among people with whom i couldconverse upon even terms and walk about the streets and fields withoutbeing afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy  but mydeliverance came sooner than i expected and in a manner not very commonthe whole story and circumstances of which i shall faithfully relatei had now been two years in this country and about the beginning of thethird glumdalclitch and i attended the king and queen in a progress tothe south coast of the kingdom  i was carried as usual in mytravellingbox which as i have already described was a very convenientcloset of twelve feet wide  and i had ordered a hammock to be fixed bysilken ropes from the four corners at the top to break the jolts when aservant carried me before him on horseback as i sometimes desired andwould often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road  on theroof of my closet not directly over the middle of the hammock i orderedthe joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square to give me air in hotweather as i slept which hole i shut at pleasure with a board that drewbackward and forward through a groovewhen we came to our journeys end the king thought proper to pass a fewdays at a palace he has near flanflasnic a city within eighteen englishmiles of the seaside  glumdalclitch and i were much fatigued i hadgotten a small cold but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined toher chamber  i longed to see the ocean which must be the only scene ofmy escape if ever it should happen  i pretended to be worse than ireally was and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea with apage whom i was very fond of and who had sometimes been trusted withme  i shall never forget with what unwillingness glumdalclitchconsented nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of mebursting at the same time into a flood of tears as if she had someforboding of what was to happen  the boy took me out in my box abouthalf an hours walk from the palace towards the rocks on the seashorei ordered him to set me down and lifting up one of my sashes cast manya wistful melancholy look towards the sea  i found myself not very welland told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock which ihoped would do me good  i got in and the boy shut the window closedown to keep out the cold  i soon fell asleep and all i can conjectureis while i slept the page thinking no danger could happen went amongthe rocks to look for birds eggs having before observed him from mywindow searching about and picking up one or two in the clefts  be thatas it will i found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon thering which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency ofcarriage  i felt my box raised very high in the air and then borneforward with prodigious speed  the first jolt had like to have shaken meout of my hammock but afterward the motion was easy enough  i calledout several times as loud as i could raise my voice but all to nopurpose  i looked towards my windows and could see nothing but theclouds and sky  i heard a noise just over my head like the clapping ofwings and then began to perceive the woful condition i was in that someeagle had got the ring of my box in his beak with an intent to let itfall on a rock like a tortoise in a shell and then pick out my bodyand devour it for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him todiscover his quarry at a great distance though better concealed than icould be within a twoinch boardin a little time i observed the noise and flutter of wings to increasevery fast and my box was tossed up and down like a sign in a windy dayi heard several bangs or buffets as i thought given to the eagle forsuch i am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in hisbeak and then all on a sudden felt myself falling perpendicularlydown for above a minute but with such incredible swiftness that ialmost lost my breath  my fall was stopped by a terrible squash thatsounded louder to my ears than the cataract of niagara after which iwas quite in the dark for another minute and then my box began to riseso high that i could see light from the tops of the windows  i nowperceived i was fallen into the sea  my box by the weight of my bodythe goods that were in and the broad plates of iron fixed for strengthat the four corners of the top and bottom floated about five feet deepin water  i did then and do now suppose that the eagle which flew awaywith my box was pursued by two or three others and forced to let medrop while he defended himself against the rest who hoped to share inthe prey  the plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box forthose were the strongest preserved the balance while it fell andhindered it from being broken on the surface of the water every joint ofit was well grooved and the door did not move on hinges but up and downlike a sash which kept my closet so tight that very little water camein  i got with much difficulty out of my hammock having first venturedto draw back the slipboard on the roof already mentioned contrived onpurpose to let in air for want of which i found myself almost stifledhow often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whomone single hour had so far divided me  and i may say with truth that inthe midst of my own misfortunes i could not forbear lamenting my poornurse the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasure of thequeen and the ruin of her fortune  perhaps many travellers have notbeen under greater difficulties and distress than i was at this junctureexpecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces or at leastoverset by the first violent blast or rising wave  a breach in onesingle pane of glass would have been immediate death nor could any thinghave preserved the windows but the strong lattice wires placed on theoutside against accidents in travelling  i saw the water ooze in atseveral crannies although the leaks were not considerable and iendeavoured to stop them as well as i could  i was not able to lift upthe roof of my closet which otherwise i certainly should have done andsat on the top of it where i might at least preserve myself some hourslonger than by being shut up as i may call it in the hold  or if iescaped these dangers for a day or two what could i expect but amiserable death of cold and hunger  i was four hours under thesecircumstances expecting and indeed wishing every moment to be my lasti have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixedupon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servantwho used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckleit about his waist  being in this disconsolate state i heard or atleast thought i heard some kind of grating noise on that side of my boxwhere the staples were fixed and soon after i began to fancy that thebox was pulled or towed along the sea for i now and then felt a sort oftugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows leavingme almost in the dark  this gave me some faint hopes of relief althoughi was not able to imagine how it could be brought about  i ventured tounscrew one of my chairs which were always fastened to the floor andhaving made a hard shift to screw it down again directly under theslippingboard that i had lately opened i mounted on the chair andputting my mouth as near as i could to the hole i called for help in aloud voice and in all the languages i understood  i then fastened myhandkerchief to a stick i usually carried and thrusting it up the holewaved it several times in the air that if any boat or ship were nearthe seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the boxi found no effect from all i could do but plainly perceived my closet tobe moved along and in the space of an hour or better that side of thebox where the staples were and had no windows struck against somethingthat was hard  i apprehended it to be a rock and found myself tossedmore than ever  i plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closetlike that of a cable and the grating of it as it passed through thering  i then found myself hoisted up by degrees at least three feethigher than i was before  whereupon i again thrust up my stick andhandkerchief calling for help till i was almost hoarse  in return towhich i heard a great shout repeated three times giving me suchtransports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel themi now heard a trampling over my head and somebody calling through thehole with a loud voice in the english tongue if there be any bodybelow let them speak  i answered i was an englishman drawn by illfortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent andbegged by all that was moving to be delivered out of the dungeon i wasin  the voice replied i was safe for my box was fastened to theirship and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in thecover large enough to pull me out  i answered that was needless andwould take up too much time for there was no more to be done but letone of the crew put his finger into the ring and take the box out of thesea into the ship and so into the captains cabin  some of them uponhearing me talk so wildly thought i was mad others laughed for indeedit never came into my head that i was now got among people of my ownstature and strength  the carpenter came and in a few minutes sawed apassage about four feet square then let down a small ladder upon whichi mounted and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak conditionthe sailors were all in amazement and asked me a thousand questionswhich i had no inclination to answer  i was equally confounded at thesight of so many pigmies for such i took them to be after having solong accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects i had left  but thecaptain mr thomas wilcocks an honest worthy shropshire man observingi was ready to faint took me into his cabin gave me a cordial tocomfort me and made me turn in upon his own bed advising me to take alittle rest of which i had great need  before i went to sleep i gavehim to understand that i had some valuable furniture in my box too goodto be lost a fine hammock a handsome fieldbed two chairs a tableand a cabinet that my closet was hung on all sides or rather quiltedwith silk and cotton that if he would let one of the crew bring mycloset into his cabin i would open it there before him and show him mygoods  the captain hearing me utter these absurdities concluded i wasraving however i suppose to pacify me he promised to give order as idesired and going upon deck sent some of his men down into my closetwhence as i afterwards found they drew up all my goods and strippedoff the quilting but the chairs cabinet and bedstead being screwed tothe floor were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen who torethem up by force  then they knocked off some of the boards for the useof the ship and when they had got all they had a mind for let the hulldrop into the sea which by reason of many breaches made in the bottomand sides sunk to rights  and indeed i was glad not to have been aspectator of the havoc they made because i am confident it would havesensibly touched me by bringing former passages into my mind which iwould rather have forgoti slept some hours but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place ihad left and the dangers i had escaped  however upon waking i foundmyself much recovered  it was now about eight oclock at night and thecaptain ordered supper immediately thinking i had already fasted toolong  he entertained me with great kindness observing me not to lookwildly or talk inconsistently and when we were left alone desired iwould give him a relation of my travels and by what accident i came tobe set adrift in that monstrous wooden chest  he said that abouttwelve oclock at noon as he was looking through his glass he spied itat a distance and thought it was a sail which he had a mind to makebeing not much out of his course in hopes of buying some biscuit hisown beginning to fall short  that upon coming nearer and finding hiserror he sent out his longboat to discover what it was that his mencame back in a fright swearing they had seen a swimming house  that helaughed at their folly and went himself in the boat ordering his men totake a strong cable along with them  that the weather being calm herowed round me several times observed my windows and wire lattices thatdefended them  that he discovered two staples upon one side which wasall of boards without any passage for light  he then commanded his mento row up to that side and fastening a cable to one of the staplesordered them to tow my chest as they called it toward the ship  whenit was there he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ringfixed in the cover and to raise up my chest with pulleys which all thesailors were not able to do above two or three feet  he said they sawmy stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and concluded that someunhappy man must be shut up in the cavity  i asked whether he or thecrew had seen any prodigious birds in the air about the time he firstdiscovered me  to which he answered that discoursing this matter withthe sailors while i was asleep one of them said he had observed threeeagles flying towards the north but remarked nothing of their beinglarger than the usual size which i suppose must be imputed to the greatheight they were at and he could not guess the reason of my question  ithen asked the captain how far he reckoned we might be from land  hesaid by the best computation he could make we were at least a hundredleagues  i assured him that he must be mistaken by almost half for ihad not left the country whence i came above two hours before i droppedinto the sea  whereupon he began again to think that my brain wasdisturbed of which he gave me a hint and advised me to go to bed in acabin he had provided  i assured him i was well refreshed with hisgood entertainment and company and as much in my senses as ever i was inmy life  he then grew serious and desired to ask me freely whether iwere not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crimefor which i was punished at the command of some prince by exposing mein that chest as great criminals in other countries have been forcedto sea in a leaky vessel without provisions for although he should besorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship yet he would engage hisword to set me safe ashore in the first port where we arrived  headded that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurdspeeches i had delivered at first to his sailors and afterwards tohimself in relation to my closet or chest as well as by my odd looksand behaviour while i was at supperi begged his patience to hear me tell my story which i faithfully didfrom the last time i left england to the moment he first discovered meand as truth always forces its way into rational minds so this honestworthy gentleman who had some tincture of learning and very good sensewas immediately convinced of my candour and veracity  but further toconfirm all i had said i entreated him to give order that my cabinetshould be brought of which i had the key in my pocket for he hadalready informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet  i opened it inhis own presence and showed him the small collection of rarities i madein the country from which i had been so strangely delivered  there wasthe comb i had contrived out of the stumps of the kings beard andanother of the same materials but fixed into a paring of her majestysthumbnail which served for the back  there was a collection of needlesand pins from a foot to half a yard long four wasp stings likejoiners tacks some combings of the queens hair a gold ring which oneday she made me a present of in a most obliging manner taking it fromher little finger and throwing it over my head like a collar  i desiredthe captain would please to accept this ring in return for hiscivilities which he absolutely refused  i showed him a corn that i hadcut off with my own hand from a maid of honours toe it was about thebigness of kentish pippin and grown so hard that when i returnedengland i got it hollowed into a cup and set in silver  lastly idesired him to see the breeches i had then on which were made of amouses skini could force nothing on him but a footmans tooth which i observed himto examine with great curiosity and found he had a fancy for it  hereceived it with abundance of thanks more than such a trifle coulddeserve  it was drawn by an unskilful surgeon in a mistake from one ofglumdalclitchs men who was afflicted with the toothache but it was assound as any in his head  i got it cleaned and put it into my cabinetit was about a foot long and four inches in diameterthe captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation i had givenhim and said he hoped when we returned to england i would oblige theworld by putting it on paper and making it public  my answer wasthat we were overstocked with books of travels that nothing could nowpass which was not extraordinary wherein i doubted some authors lessconsulted truth than their own vanity or interest or the diversion ofignorant readers that my story could contain little beside commonevents without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants treesbirds and other animals or of the barbarous customs and idolatry ofsavage people with which most writers abound  however i thanked himfor his good opinion and promised to take the matter into my thoughtshe said he wondered at one thing very much which was to hear me speakso loud asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thickof hearing  i told him it was what i had been used to for above twoyears past and that i admired as much at the voices of him and his menwho seemed to me only to whisper and yet i could hear them well enoughbut when i spoke in that country it was like a man talking in thestreets to another looking out from the top of a steeple unless when iwas placed on a table or held in any persons hand  i told him i hadlikewise observed another thing that when i first got into the shipand the sailors stood all about me i thought they were the most littlecontemptible creatures i had ever beheld  for indeed while i was inthat princes country i could never endure to look in a glass aftermine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects because thecomparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself  the captain saidthat while we were at supper he observed me to look at every thing witha sort of wonder and that i often seemed hardly able to contain mylaughter which he knew not well how to take but imputed it to somedisorder in my brain  i answered it was very true and i wondered howi could forbear when i saw his dishes of the size of a silverthreepence a leg of pork hardly a mouthful a cup not so big as anutshell and so i went on describing the rest of his householdstuffand provisions after the same manner  for although he queen hadordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me while i was inher service yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what i saw on everyside of me and i winked at my own littleness as people do at their ownfaults  the captain understood my raillery very well and merrilyreplied with the old english proverb that he doubted mine eyes werebigger than my belly for he did not observe my stomach so good althoughi had fasted all day and continuing in his mirth protested he wouldhave gladly given a hundred pounds to have seen my closet in the eaglesbill and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the seawhich would certainly have been a most astonishing object worthy to havethe description of it transmitted to future ages and the comparison ofphaton was so obvious that he could not forbear applying it although idid not much admire the conceitthe captain having been at tonquin was in his return to england drivennortheastward to the latitude of  degrees and longitude of   butmeeting a tradewind two days after i came on board him we sailedsouthward a long time and coasting new holland kept our coursewestsouthwest and then southsouthwest till we doubled the cape ofgood hope  our voyage was very prosperous but i shall not trouble thereader with a journal of it  the captain called in at one or two portsand sent in his longboat for provisions and fresh water but i neverwent out of the ship till we came into the downs which was on the thirdday of june  about nine months after my escape  i offered to leavemy goods in security for payment of my freight but the captain protestedhe would not receive one farthing  we took a kind leave of each otherand i made him promise he would come to see me at my house in redriff  ihired a horse and guide for five shillings which i borrowed of thecaptainas i was on the road observing the littleness of the houses the treesthe cattle and the people i began to think myself in lilliput  i wasafraid of trampling on every traveller i met and often called aloud tohave them stand out of the way so that i had like to have gotten one ortwo broken heads for my impertinencewhen i came to my own house for which i was forced to inquire one ofthe servants opening the door i bent down to go in like a goose undera gate for fear of striking my head  my wife run out to embrace mebut i stooped lower than her knees thinking she could otherwise never beable to reach my mouth  my daughter kneeled to ask my blessing but icould not see her till she arose having been so long used to stand withmy head and eyes erect to above sixty feet and then i went to take herup with one hand by the waist  i looked down upon the servants and oneor two friends who were in the house as if they had been pigmies and i agiant  i told my wife she had been too thrifty for i found she hadstarved herself and her daughter to nothing  in short i behaved myselfso unaccountably that they were all of the captains opinion when hefirst saw me and concluded i had lost my wits  this i mention as aninstance of the great power of habit and prejudicein a little time i and my family and friends came to a rightunderstanding but my wife protested i should never go to sea any morealthough my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to hinder meas the reader may know hereafter  in the mean time i here conclude thesecond part of my unfortunate voyagespart iii  a voyage to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib andjapanchapter ithe author sets out on his third voyage  is taken by pirates  themalice of a dutchman  his arrival at an island  he is received intolaputai had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson acornish man commander of the hopewell a stout ship of three hundredtons came to my house  i had formerly been surgeon of another shipwhere he was master and a fourth part owner in a voyage to the levanthe had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officerand hearing of my arrival made me a visit as i apprehended only out offriendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after longabsences  but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find ime in good health asking whether i were now settled for life addingthat he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months at last heplainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of theship that i should have another surgeon under me beside our two matesthat my salary should be double to the usual pay and that havingexperienced my knowledge in seaaffairs to be at least equal to his hewould enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if i hadshared in the commandhe said so many other obliging things and i knew him to be so honest aman that i could not reject this proposal the thirst i had of seeingthe world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent asever  the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whoseconsent however i at last obtained by the prospect of advantage sheproposed to her childrenwe set out the th day of august  and arrived at fort st georgethe th of april   we staid there three weeks to refresh our crewmany of whom were sick  from thence we went to tonquin where thecaptain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods heintended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched inseveral months  therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges hemust be at he bought a sloop loaded it with several sorts of goodswherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands andputting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country heappointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while hetransacted his affairs at tonquinwe had not sailed above three days when a great storm arising we weredriven five days to the northnortheast and then to the east afterwhich we had fair weather but still with a pretty strong gale from thewest  upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soonovertook us for my sloop was so deep laden that she sailed very slowneither were we in a condition to defend ourselveswe were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who enteredfuriously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon ourfaces for so i gave order they pinioned us with strong ropes andsetting guard upon us went to search the sloopi observed among them a dutchman who seemed to be of some authoritythough he was not commander of either ship  he knew us by ourcountenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own languageswore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea  i spokendutch tolerably well i told him who we were and begged him inconsideration of our being christians and protestants of neighbouringcountries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to takesome pity on us  this inflamed his rage he repeated his threateningsand turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japaneselanguage as i suppose often using the word christianosthe largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captainwho spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly  he came up to me andafter several questions which i answered in great humility he said weshould not die  i made the captain a very low bow and then turning tothe dutchman said i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than ina brother christian  but i had soon reason to repent those foolishwords for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in vain topersuade both the captains that i might be thrown into the sea whichthey would not yield to after the promise made me that i should notdie however prevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on meworse in all human appearance than death itself  my men were sent byan equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new mannedas to myself it was determined that i should be set adrift in a smallcanoe with paddles and a sail and four days provisions which lastthe japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores andwould permit no man to search me  i got down into the canoe while thedutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses andinjurious terms his language could affordabout an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation andfound we were in the latitude of  n and longitude of   when i wasat some distance from the pirates i discovered by my pocketglassseveral islands to the southeast  i set up my sail the wind beingfair with a design to reach the nearest of those islands which i made ashift to do in about three hours  it was all rocky however i got manybirds eggs and striking fire i kindled some heath and dry seaweedby which i roasted my eggs  i ate no other supper being resolved tospare my provisions as much as i could  i passed the night under theshelter of a rock strewing some heath under me and slept pretty wellthe next day i sailed to another island and thence to a third andfourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles  but not totrouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses let itsuffice that on the fifth day i arrived at the last island in my sightwhich lay southsoutheast to the formerthis island was at a greater distance than i expected and i did notreach it in less than five hours  i encompassed it almost round beforei could find a convenient place to land in which was a small creekabout three times the wideness of my canoe  i found the island to be allrocky only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweetsmellingherbs  i took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myselfi secured the remainder in a cave whereof there were great numbers igathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got a quantity of dryseaweed and parched grass which i designed to kindle the next day androast my eggs as well as i could for i had about me my flint steelmatch and burningglass  i lay all night in the cave where i had lodgedmy provisions  my bed was the same dry grass and seaweed which iintended for fuel  i slept very little for the disquiets of my mindprevailed over my weariness and kept me awake  i considered howimpossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place and howmiserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and despondingthat i had not the heart to rise and before i could get spirits enoughto creep out of my cave the day was far advanced  i walked awhile amongthe rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that i wasforced to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it became obscureas i thought in a manner very different from what happens by theinterposition of a cloud  i turned back and perceived a vast opaquebody between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemedto be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but idid not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened thanif i had stood under the shade of a mountain  as it approached nearerover the place where i was it appeared to be a firm substance thebottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of thesea below  i stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shoreand saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me at lessthan an english mile distance  i took out my pocket perspective andcould plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides ofit which appeared to be sloping but what those people where doing i wasnot able to distinguishthe natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy and i wasready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or otherhelp to deliver me from the desolate place and condition i was in  butat the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment tobehold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able as itshould seem to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as theypleased  but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophiseupon this phenomenon i rather chose to observe what course the islandwould take because it seemed for awhile to stand still  yet soon afterit advanced nearer and i could see the sides of it encompassed withseveral gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals todescend from one to the other  in the lowest gallery i beheld somepeople fishing with long angling rods and others looking on  i waved mycap for my hat was long since worn out and my handkerchief toward theisland and upon its nearer approach i called and shouted with theutmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly i beheld acrowd gather to that side which was most in my view  i found by theirpointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered mealthough they made no return to my shouting  but i could see four orfive men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the islandwho then disappeared  i happened rightly to conjecture that these weresent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasionthe number of people increased and in less than half all hour theisland was moved and raised in such a manner that the lowest galleryappeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from theheight where i stood  i then put myself in the most supplicatingposture and spoke in the humblest accent but received no answer  thosewho stood nearest over against me seemed to be persons of distinctionas i supposed by their habit  they conferred earnestly with each otherlooking often upon me  at length one of them called out in a clearpolite smooth dialect not unlike in sound to the italian and thereforei returned an answer in that language hoping at least that the cadencemight be more agreeable to his ears  although neither of us understoodthe other yet my meaning was easily known for the people saw thedistress i was inthey made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards theshore which i accordingly did and the flying island being raised to aconvenient height the verge directly over me a chain was let down fromthe lowest gallery with a seat fastened to the bottom to which i fixedmyself and was drawn up by pulleyschapter iithe humours and dispositions of the laputians described  an account oftheir learning  of the king and his court  the authors receptionthere  the inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes  an account ofthe womenat my alighting i was surrounded with a crowd of people but those whostood nearest seemed to be of better quality  they beheld me with allthe marks and circumstances of wonder neither indeed was i much in theirdebt having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in theirshapes habits and countenances  their heads were all reclined eitherto the right or the left one of their eyes turned inward and the otherdirectly up to the zenith  their outward garments were adorned with thefigures of suns moons and stars interwoven with those of fiddlesflutes harps trumpets guitars harpsichords and many otherinstruments of music unknown to us in europe  i observed here andthere many in the habit of servants with a blown bladder fastened likea flail to the end of a stick which they carried in their hands  ineach bladder was a small quantity of dried peas or little pebbles as iwas afterwards informed  with these bladders they now and then flappedthe mouths and ears of those who stood near them of which practice icould not then conceive the meaning  it seems the minds of these peopleare so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can speaknor attend to the discourses of others without being roused by someexternal taction upon the organs of speech and hearing for which reasonthose persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper theoriginal is climenole in their family as one of their domestics norever walk abroad or make visits without him  and the business of thisofficer is when two three or more persons are in company gently tostrike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the rightear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself  this flapperis likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks andupon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes because he is alwaysso wrapped up in cogitation that he is in manifest danger of fallingdown every precipice and bouncing his head against every post and inthe streets of justling others or being justled himself into thekennelit was necessary to give the reader this information without which hewould be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of thesepeople as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island andfrom thence to the royal palace  while we were ascending they forgotseveral times what they were about and left me to myself till theirmemories were again roused by their flappers for they appearedaltogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance andby the shouts of the vulgar whose thoughts and minds were moredisengagedat last we entered the palace and proceeded into the chamber ofpresence where i saw the king seated on his throne attended on eachside by persons of prime quality  before the throne was a large tablefilled with globes and spheres and mathematical instruments of allkinds  his majesty took not the least notice of us although ourentrance was not without sufficient noise by the concourse of allpersons belonging to the court  but he was then deep in a problem andwe attended at least an hour before he could solve it  there stood byhim on each side a young page with flaps in their hands and when theysaw he was at leisure one of them gently struck his mouth and the otherhis right ear at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden andlooking towards me and the company i was in recollected the occasion ofour coming whereof he had been informed before  he spoke some wordswhereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side andflapped me gently on the right ear but i made signs as well as i couldthat i had no occasion for such an instrument which as i afterwardsfound gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opinion of myunderstanding  the king as far as i could conjecture asked me severalquestions and i addressed myself to him in all the languages i hadwhen it was found i could neither understand nor be understood i wasconducted by his order to an apartment in his palace this prince beingdistinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality tostrangers where two servants were appointed to attend me  my dinnerwas brought and four persons of quality whom i remembered to have seenvery near the kings person did me the honour to dine with me  we hadtwo courses of three dishes each  in the first course there was ashoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle a piece of beef intoa rhomboides and a pudding into a cycloid  the second course was twoducks trussed up in the form of fiddles sausages and puddings resemblingflutes and hautboys and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp  theservants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and severalother mathematical figureswhile we were at dinner i made bold to ask the names of several thingsin their language and those noble persons by the assistance of theirflappers delighted to give me answers hoping to raise my admiration oftheir great abilities if i could be brought to converse with them  i wassoon able to call for bread and drink or whatever else i wantedafter dinner my company withdrew and a person was sent to me by thekings order attended by a flapper  he brought with him pen ink andpaper and three or four books giving me to understand by signs that hewas sent to teach me the language  we sat together four hours in whichtime i wrote down a great number of words in columns with thetranslations over against them i likewise made a shift to learn severalshort sentences for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetchsomething to turn about to make a bow to sit or to stand or walkand the like  then i took down the sentence in writing  he showed mealso in one of his books the figures of the sun moon and stars thezodiac the tropics and polar circles together with the denominationsof many plains and solids  he gave me the names and descriptions of allthe musical instruments and the general terms of art in playing on eachof them  after he had left me i placed all my words with theirinterpretations in alphabetical order  and thus in a few days by thehelp of a very faithful memory i got some insight into their languagethe word which i interpret the flying or floating island is in theoriginal laputa whereof i could never learn the true etymologylap in the old obsolete language signifies high and untuh agovernor from which they say by corruption was derived laputa fromlapuntuh  but i do not approve of this derivation which seems to be alittle strained  i ventured to offer to the learned among them aconjecture of my own that laputa was quasi lap outed lapsignifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea and outeda wing which however i shall not obtrude but submit to the judiciousreaderthose to whom the king had entrusted me observing how ill i was cladordered a tailor to come next morning and take measure for a suit ofclothes  this operator did his office after a different manner fromthose of his trade in europe  he first took my altitude by a quadrantand then with a rule and compasses described the dimensions andoutlines of my whole body all which he entered upon paper and in sixdays brought my clothes very ill made and quite out of shape byhappening to mistake a figure in the calculation  but my comfort wasthat i observed such accidents very frequent and little regardedduring my confinement for want of clothes and by an indisposition thatheld me some days longer i much enlarged my dictionary and when i wentnext to court was able to understand many things the king spoke and toreturn him some kind of answers  his majesty had given orders that theisland should move northeast and by east to the vertical point overlagado the metropolis of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earthit was about ninety leagues distant and our voyage lasted four days anda half  i was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion madein the air by the island  on the second morning about eleven oclockthe king himself in person attended by his nobility courtiers andofficers having prepared all their musical instruments played on themfor three hours without intermission so that i was quite stunned withthe noise neither could i possibly guess the meaning till my tutorinformed me  he said that the people of their island had their earsadapted to hear the music of the spheres which always played at certainperiods and the court was now prepared to bear their part in whateverinstrument they most excelledin our journey towards lagado the capital city his majesty ordered thatthe island should stop over certain towns and villages from whence hemight receive the petitions of his subjects  and to this purposeseveral packthreads were let down with small weights at the bottom  onthese packthreads the people strung their petitions which mounted updirectly like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end ofthe string that holds their kite  sometimes we received wine andvictuals from below which were drawn up by pulleysthe knowledge i had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiringtheir phraseology which depended much upon that science and music andin the latter i was not unskilled  their ideas are perpetuallyconversant in lines and figures  if they would for example praise thebeauty of a woman or any other animal they describe it by rhombscircles parallelograms ellipses and other geometrical terms or bywords of art drawn from music needless here to repeat  i observed inthe kings kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instrumentsafter the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to hismajestys tabletheir houses are very ill built the walls bevil without one right anglein any apartment and this defect arises from the contempt they bear topractical geometry which they despise as vulgar and mechanic thoseinstructions they give being too refined for the intellects of theirworkmen which occasions perpetual mistakes  and although they aredexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the management of the rulethe pencil and the divider yet in the common actions and behaviour oflife i have not seen a more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor soslow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects exceptthose of mathematics and music  they are very bad reasoners andvehemently given to opposition unless when they happen to be of theright opinion which is seldom their case  imagination fancy andinvention they are wholly strangers to nor have any words in theirlanguage by which those ideas can be expressed the whole compass oftheir thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementionedsciencesmost of them and especially those who deal in the astronomical parthave great faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to ownit publicly  but what i chiefly admired and thought altogetherunaccountable was the strong disposition i observed in them towards newsand politics perpetually inquiring into public affairs giving theirjudgments in matters of state and passionately disputing every inch of aparty opinion  i have indeed observed the same disposition among most ofthe mathematicians i have known in europe although i could neverdiscover the least analogy between the two sciences unless those peoplesuppose that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as thelargest therefore the regulation and management of the world require nomore abilities than the handling and turning of a globe but i rathertake this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human natureinclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we haveleast concern and for which we are least adapted by study or naturethese people are under continual disquietudes never enjoying a minutespeace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which verylittle affect the rest of mortals  their apprehensions arise fromseveral changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance thatthe earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must incourse of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sunwill by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no morelight to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from thetail of the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashesand that the next which they have calculated for oneandthirty yearshence will probably destroy us  for if in its perihelion it shouldapproach within a certain degree of the sun as by their calculationsthey have reason to dread it will receive a degree of heat ten thousandtimes more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absencefrom the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteenmiles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance ofone hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the cometit must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that thesun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them willat last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended withthe destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive theirlight from itthey are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and thelike impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in theirbeds nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements oflife  when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first questionis about the suns health how he looked at his setting and rising andwhat hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet  thisconversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boysdiscover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits andhobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed forfearthe women of the island have abundance of vivacity they contemn theirhusbands and are exceedingly fond of strangers whereof there is alwaysa considerable number from the continent below attending at courteither upon affairs of the several towns and corporations or their ownparticular occasions but are much despised because they want the sameendowments  among these the ladies choose their gallants but thevexation is that they act with too much ease and security for thehusband is always so rapt in speculation that the mistress and lover mayproceed to the greatest familiarities before his face if he be butprovided with paper and implements and without his flapper at his sidethe wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island althoughi think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world and althoughthey live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence and are allowedto do whatever they please they long to see the world and take thediversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to do without aparticular license from the king and this is not easy to be obtainedbecause the people of quality have found by frequent experience howhard it is to persuade their women to return from below  i was told thata great court lady who had several childrenis married to the primeminister the richest subject in the kingdom a very graceful personextremely fond of her and lives in the finest palace of the islandwentdown to lagado on the pretence of health there hid herself for severalmonths till the king sent a warrant to search for her and she was foundin an obscure eatinghouse all in rags having pawned her clothes tomaintain an old deformed footman who beat her every day and in whosecompany she was taken much against her will  and although her husbandreceived her with all possible kindness and without the least reproachshe soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels to thesame gallant and has not been heard of sincethis may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or englishstory than for one of a country so remote  but he may please toconsider that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climateor nation and that they are much more uniform than can be easilyimaginedin about a months time i had made a tolerable proficiency in theirlanguage and was able to answer most of the kings questions when i hadthe honour to attend him  his majesty discovered not the least curiosityto inquire into the laws government history religion or manners ofthe countries where i had been but confined his questions to the stateof mathematics and received the account i gave him with great contemptand indifference though often roused by his flapper on each sidechapter iiia phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy  the laputiansgreat improvements in the latter  the kings method of suppressinginsurrectionsi desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the islandwhich he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor to attendme  i chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature itowed its several motions whereof i will now give a philosophical accountto the readerthe flying or floating island is exactly circular its diameter yards or about four miles and a half and consequently contains tenthousand acres  it is three hundred yards thick  the bottom or undersurface which appears to those who view it below is one even regularplate of adamant shooting up to the height of about two hundred yardsabove it lie the several minerals in their usual order and over all is acoat of rich mould ten or twelve feet deep  the declivity of the uppersurface from the circumference to the centre is the natural cause whyall the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed in smallrivulets toward the middle where they are emptied into four largebasins each of about half a mile in circuit and two hundred yardsdistant from the centre  from these basins the water is continuallyexhaled by the sun in the daytime which effectually prevents theiroverflowing  besides as it is in the power of the monarch to raise theisland above the region of clouds and vapours he can prevent the fallingof dews and rain whenever he pleases  for the highest clouds cannot riseabove two miles as naturalists agree at least they were never known todo so in that countryat the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards indiameter whence the astronomers descend into a large dome which istherefore called flandona gagnole or the astronomers cave situatedat the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamantin this cave are twenty lamps continually burning which from thereflection of the adamant cast a strong light into every part  theplace is stored with great variety of sextants quadrants telescopesastrolabes and other astronomical instruments  but the greatestcuriosity upon which the fate of the island depends is a loadstone of aprodigious size in shape resembling a weavers shuttle  it is in lengthsix yards and in the thickest part at least three yards over  thismagnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through itsmiddle upon which it plays and is poised so exactly that the weakesthand can turn it  it is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamantfour feet yards in diameter placed horizontally and supported by eightadamantine feet each six yards high  in the middle of the concave sidethere is a groove twelve inches deep in which the extremities of theaxle are lodged and turned round as there is occasionthe stone cannot be removed from its place by any force because the hoopand its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant whichconstitutes the bottom of the islandby means of this loadstone the island is made to rise and fall and movefrom one place to another  for with respect to that part of the earthover which the monarch presides the stone is endued at one of its sideswith an attractive power and at the other with a repulsive  uponplacing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the earth theisland descends but when the repelling extremity points downwards theisland mounts directly upwards  when the position of the stone isoblique the motion of the island is so too for in this magnet theforces always act in lines parallel to its directionby this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of themonarchs dominions  to explain the manner of its progress let a brepresent a line drawn across the dominions of balnibarbi let the linec d represent the loadstone of which let d be the repelling endand c the attracting end the island being over c let the stone beplaced in position c d with its repelling end downwards then theisland will be driven upwards obliquely towards d  when it is arrivedat d let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting endpoints towards e and then the island will be carried obliquely towardse where if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands inthe position e f with its repelling point downwards the island willrise obliquely towards f where by directing the attracting endtowards g the island may be carried to g and from g to h byturning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity to pointdirectly downward  and thus by changing the situation of the stone asoften as there is occasion the island is made to rise and fall by turnsin an oblique direction and by those alternate risings and fallings theobliquity being not considerable is conveyed from one part of thedominions to the otherbut it must be observed that this island cannot move beyond the extentof the dominions below nor can it rise above the height of four milesfor which the astronomers who have written large systems concerning thestone assign the following reason that the magnetic virtue does notextend beyond the distance of four miles and that the mineral whichacts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth and in the sea about sixleagues distant from the shore is not diffused through the whole globebut terminated with the limits of the kings dominions and it was easyfrom the great advantage of such a superior situation for a prince tobring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction ofthat magnetwhen the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the islandstands still for in that case the extremities of it being at equaldistance from the earth act with equal force the one in drawingdownwards the other in pushing upwards and consequently no motion canensuethis loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers who from timeto time give it such positions as the monarch directs  they spend thegreatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies whichthey do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodnessfor although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet theymagnify much more than those of a hundred with us and show the starswith greater clearness  this advantage has enabled them to extend theirdiscoveries much further than our astronomers in europe for they havemade a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of oursdo not contain above one third part of that number  they have likewisediscovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about marswhereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planetexactly three of his diameters and the outermost five the formerrevolves in the space of ten hours and the latter in twentyone and ahalf so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in thesame proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of marswhich evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitationthat influences the other heavenly bodiesthey have observed ninetythree different comets and settled theirperiods with great exactness  if this be true and they affirm it withgreat confidence it is much to be wished that their observations weremade public whereby the theory of comets which at present is very lameand defective might be brought to the same perfection with other arts ofastronomythe king would be the most absolute prince in the universe if he couldbut prevail on a ministry to join with him but these having theirestates below on the continent and considering that the office of afavourite has a very uncertain tenure would never consent to theenslaving of their countryif any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny fall into violentfactions or refuse to pay the usual tribute the king has two methods ofreducing them to obedience  the first and the mildest course is bykeeping the island hovering over such a town and the lands about itwhereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain andconsequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if thecrime deserve it they are at the same time pelted from above with greatstones against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellarsor caves while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces  but ifthey still continue obstinate or offer to raise insurrections heproceeds to the last remedy by letting the island drop directly upontheir heads which makes a universal destruction both of houses and menhowever this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom drivenneither indeed is he willing to put it in execution nor dare hisministers advise him to an action which as it would render them odiousto the people so it would be a great damage to their own estates whichall lie below for the island is the kings demesnebut there is still indeed a more weighty reason why the kings of thiscountry have been always averse from executing so terrible an actionunless upon the utmost necessity  for if the town intended to bedestroyed should have in it any tall rocks as it generally falls out inthe larger cities a situation probably chosen at first with a view toprevent such a catastrophe or if it abound in high spires or pillars ofstone a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of theisland which although it consist as i have said of one entireadamant two hundred yards thick might happen to crack by too great ashock or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses belowas the backs both of iron and stone will often do in our chimneys  ofall this the people are well apprised and understand how far to carrytheir obstinacy where their liberty or property is concerned  and theking when he is highest provoked and most determined to press a city torubbish orders the island to descend with great gentleness out of apretence of tenderness to his people but indeed for fear of breakingthe adamantine bottom in which case it is the opinion of all theirphilosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up and thewhole mass would fall to the groundby a fundamental law of this realm neither the king nor either of histwo eldest sons are permitted to leave the island

hospitably received by a great lord  his conversation withthat lordalthough i cannot say that i was ill treated in this island yet i mustconfess i thought myself too much neglected not without some degree ofcontempt for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in anypart of knowledge except mathematics and music wherein i was far theirinferior and upon that account very little regardedon the other side after having seen all the curiosities of the island iwas very desirous to leave it being heartily weary of those peoplethey were indeed excellent in two sciences for which i have great esteemand wherein i am not unversed but at the same time so abstracted andinvolved in speculation that i never met with such disagreeablecompanions  i conversed only with women tradesmen flappers andcourtpages during two months of my abode there by which at last irendered myself extremely contemptible yet these were the only peoplefrom whom i could ever receive a reasonable answeri had obtained by hard study a good degree of knowledge in theirlanguage i was weary of being confined to an island where i received solittle countenance and resolved to leave it with the first opportunitythere was a great lord at court nearly related to the king and for thatreason alone used with respect  he was universally reckoned the mostignorant and stupid person among them  he had performed many eminentservices for the crown had great natural and acquired parts adornedwith integrity and honour but so ill an ear for music that hisdetractors reported he had been often known to beat time in the wrongplace neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach himto demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics  he waspleased to show me many marks of favour often did me the honour of avisit desired to be informed in the affairs of europe the laws andcustoms the manners and learning of the several countries where i hadtravelled  he listened to me with great attention and made very wiseobservations on all i spoke  he had two flappers attending him forstate but never made use of them except at court and in visits ofceremony and would always command them to withdraw when we were alonetogetheri entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with hismajesty for leave to depart which he accordingly did as he was pleasedto tell me with regret for indeed he had made me several offers veryadvantageous which however i refused with expressions of the highestacknowledgmenton the th of february i took leave of his majesty and the court  theking made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds englishand my protector his kinsman as much more together with a letter ofrecommendation to a friend of his in lagado the metropolis  the islandbeing then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it i was letdown from the lowest gallery in the same manner as i had been taken upthe continent as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flyingisland passes under the general name of balnibarbi and themetropolis as i said before is called lagado  i felt some littlesatisfaction in finding myself on firm ground  i walked to the citywithout any concern being clad like one of the natives and sufficientlyinstructed to converse with them  i soon found out the persons house towhom i was recommended presented my letter from his friend the grandeein the island and was received with much kindness  this great lordwhose name was munodi ordered me an apartment in his own house where icontinued during my stay and was entertained in a most hospitablemannerthe next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see thetown which is about half the bigness of london but the houses verystrangely built and most of them out of repair  the people in thestreets walked fast looked wild their eyes fixed and were generally inrags  we passed through one of the town gates and went about threemiles into the country where i saw many labourers working with severalsorts of tools in the ground but was not able to conjecture what theywere about neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grassalthough the soil appeared to be excellent  i could not forbear admiringat these odd appearances both in town and country and i made bold todesire my conductor that he would be pleased to explain to me whatcould be meant by so many busy heads hands and faces both in thestreets and the fields because i did not discover any good effects theyproduced but on the contrary i never knew a soil so unhappilycultivated houses so ill contrived and so ruinous or a people whosecountenances and habit expressed so much misery and wantthis lord munodi was a person of the first rank and had been some yearsgovernor of lagado but by a cabal of ministers was discharged forinsufficiency  however the king treated him with tenderness as awellmeaning man but of a low contemptible understandingwhen i gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he madeno further answer than by telling me that i had not been long enoughamong them to form a judgment and that the different nations of theworld had different customs with other common topics to the samepurpose  but when we returned to his palace he asked me how i likedthe building what absurdities i observed and what quarrel i had withthe dress or looks of his domestics  this he might safely do becauseevery thing about him was magnificent regular and polite  i answeredthat his excellencys prudence quality and fortune had exempted himfrom those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others  hesaid if i would go with him to his countryhouse about twenty milesdistant where his estate lay there would be more leisure for this kindof conversation  i told his excellency that i was entirely at hisdisposal and accordingly we set out next morningduring our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmersin managing their lands which to me were wholly unaccountable forexcept in some very few places i could not discover one ear of corn orblade of grass  but in three hours travelling the scene was whollyaltered we came into a most beautiful country farmers houses at smalldistances neatly built the fields enclosed containing vineyardscorngrounds and meadows  neither do i remember to have seen a moredelightful prospect  his excellency observed my countenance to clear uphe told me with a sigh that there his estate began and would continuethe same till we should come to his house that his countrymen ridiculedand despised him for managing his affairs no better and for setting soill an example to the kingdom which however was followed by very fewsuch as were old and wilful and weak like himselfwe came at length to the house which was indeed a noble structure builtaccording to the best rules of ancient architecture  the fountainsgardens walks avenues and groves were all disposed with exactjudgment and taste  i gave due praises to every thing i saw whereof hisexcellency took not the least notice till after supper when there beingno third companion he told me with a very melancholy air that hedoubted he must throw down his houses in town and country to rebuildthem after the present mode destroy all his plantations and cast othersinto such a form as modern usage required and give the same directionsto all his tenants unless he would submit to incur the censure of pridesingularity affectation ignorance caprice and perhaps increase hismajestys displeasure that the admiration i appeared to be under wouldcease or diminish when he had informed me of some particulars whichprobably i never heard of at court the people there being too muchtaken up in their own speculations to have regard to what passed herebelowthe sum of his discourse was to this effect that about forty years agocertain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversionand after five months continuance came back with a very littlesmattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in thatairy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike themanagement of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting allarts sciences languages and mechanics upon a new foot  to this endthey procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors inlagado and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people that thereis not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academyin these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods ofagriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all tradesand manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the workof ten a palace may be built in a week of materials so durable as tolast for ever without repairing  all the fruits of the earth shall cometo maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose and increase ahundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happyproposals  the only inconvenience is that none of these projects areyet brought to perfection and in the mean time the whole country liesmiserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food orclothes  by all which instead of being discouraged they are fiftytimes more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equallyon by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprisingspirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houseshis ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of lifewithout innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry haddone the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and illwillas enemies to art ignorant and ill commonwealths men preferringtheir own ease and sloth before the general improvement of theircountryhis lordship added that he would not by any further particularsprevent the pleasure i should certainly take in viewing the grandacademy whither he was resolved i should go  he only desired me toobserve a ruined building upon the side of a mountain about three milesdistant of which he gave me this account that he had a very convenientmill within half a mile of his house turned by a current from a largeriver and sufficient for his own family as well as a great number ofhis tenants that about seven years ago a club of those projectors cameto him with proposals to destroy this mill and build another on the sideof that mountain on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut fora repository of water to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supplythe mill because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water andthereby made it fitter for motion and because the water descending downa declivity would turn the mill with half the current of a river whosecourse is more upon a level  he said that being then not very wellwith the court and pressed by many of his friends he complied with theproposal and after employing a hundred men for two years the workmiscarried the projectors went off laying the blame entirely upon himrailing at him ever since and putting others upon the same experimentwith equal assurance of success as well as equal disappointmentin a few days we came back to town and his excellency considering thebad character he had in the academy would not go with me himself butrecommended me to a friend of his to bear me company thither  my lordwas pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects and a personof much curiosity and easy belief which indeed was not without truthfor i had myself been a sort of projector in my younger dayschapter vthe author permitted to see the grand academy of lagado  the academylargely described  the arts wherein the professors employ themselvesthis academy is not an entire single building but a continuation ofseveral houses on both sides of a street which growing waste waspurchased and applied to that usei was received very kindly by the warden and went for many days to theacademy  every room has in it one or more projectors and i believe icould not be in fewer than five hundred roomsthe first man i saw was of a meagre aspect with sooty hands and facehis hair and beard long ragged and singed in several places  hisclothes shirt and skin were all of the same colour  he has been eightyears upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers which wereto be put in phials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air inraw inclement summers  he told me he did not doubt that in eightyears more he should be able to supply the governors gardens withsunshine at a reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was lowand entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuityespecially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers  i madehim a small present for my lord had furnished me with money on purposebecause he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see themi went into another chamber but was ready to hasten back being almostovercome with a horrible stink  my conductor pressed me forwardconjuring me in a whisper to give no offence which would be highlyresented and therefore i durst not so much as stop my nose  theprojector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy hisface and beard were of a pale yellow his hands and clothes daubed overwith filth  when i was presented to him he gave me a close embrace acompliment i could well have excused  his employment from his firstcoming into the academy was an operation to reduce human excrement toits original food by separating the several parts removing the tincturewhich it receives from the gall making the odour exhale and scummingoff the saliva  he had a weekly allowance from the society of a vesselfilled with human ordure about the bigness of a bristol barreli saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder who likewise showedme a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire whichhe intended to publishthere was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new method forbuilding houses by beginning at the roof and working downward to thefoundation which he justified to me by the like practice of those twoprudent insects the bee and the spiderthere was a man born blind who had several apprentices in his owncondition their employment was to mix colours for painters which theirmaster taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling  it was indeedmy misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in theirlessons and the professor himself happened to be generally mistakenthis artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternityin another apartment i was highly pleased with a projector who had founda device of ploughing the ground with hogs to save the charges ofploughs cattle and labour  the method is this in an acre of groundyou bury at six inches distance and eight deep a quantity of acornsdates chestnuts and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals arefondest then you drive six hundred or more of them into the fieldwhere in a few days they will root up the whole ground in search oftheir food and make it fit for sowing at the same time manuring it withtheir dung it is true upon experiment they found the charge andtrouble very great and they had little or no crop  however it is notdoubted that this invention may be capable of great improvementi went into another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung roundwith cobwebs except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and outat my entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his webs  helamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of usingsilkworms while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitelyexcelled the former because they understood how to weave as well asspin  and he proposed further that by employing spiders the chargeof dyeing silks should be wholly saved whereof i was fully convincedwhen he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully colouredwherewith he fed his spiders assuring us that the webs would take atincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fiteverybodys fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies ofcertain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give a strength andconsistence to the threadsthere was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sundial upon thegreat weathercock on the townhouse by adjusting the annual and diurnalmotions of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincide with allaccidental turnings of the windi was complaining of a small fit of the colic upon which my conductorled me into a room where a great physician resided who was famous forcuring that disease by contrary operations from the same instrument  hehad a large pair of bellows with a long slender muzzle of ivory this heconveyed eight inches up the anus and drawing in the wind he affirmedhe could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder  but when the diseasewas more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzle while the bellowswere full of wind which he discharged into the body of the patient thenwithdrew the instrument to replenish it clapping his thumb stronglyagainst the orifice of then fundament and this being repeated three orfour times the adventitious wind would rush out bringing the noxiousalong with it like water put into a pump and the patient recoveredi saw him try both experiments upon a dog but could not discern anyeffect from the former  after the latter the animal was ready to burstand made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and mycompanion  the dog died on the spot and we left the doctor endeavouringto recover him by the same operationi visited many other apartments but shall not trouble my reader with allthe curiosities i observed being studious of brevityi had hitherto seen only one side of the academy the other beingappropriated to the advancers of speculative learning of whom i shallsay something when i have mentioned one illustrious person more who iscalled among them the universal artist  he told us he had been thirtyyears employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life  he hadtwo large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and fifty men at worksome were condensing air into a dry tangible substance by extracting thenitre and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate otherssoftening marble for pillows and pincushions others petrifying thehoofs of a living horse to preserve them from foundering  the artisthimself was at that time busy upon two great designs the first to sowland with chaff wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to becontained as he demonstrated by several experiments which i was notskilful enough to comprehend  the other was by a certain composition ofgums minerals and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growthof wool upon two young lambs and he hoped in a reasonable time topropagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdomwe crossed a walk to the other part of the academy where as i havealready said the projectors in speculative learning residedthe first professor i saw was in a very large room with forty pupilsabout him  after salutation observing me to look earnestly upon aframe which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth ofthe room he said perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in aproject for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanicaloperations  but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness andhe flattered himself that a more noble exalted thought never sprang inany other mans head  every one knew how laborious the usual method isof attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the mostignorant person at a reasonable charge and with a little bodily labourmight write books in philosophy poetry politics laws mathematics andtheology without the least assistance from genius or study  he thenled me to the frame about the sides whereof all his pupils stood inranks  it was twenty feet square placed in the middle of the room  thesuperfices was composed of several bits of wood about the bigness of adie but some larger than others  they were all linked together byslender wires  these bits of wood were covered on every square withpaper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words oftheir language in their several moods tenses and declensions butwithout any order  the professor then desired me to observe for he wasgoing to set his engine at work  the pupils at his command took eachof them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty fixed round theedges of the frame and giving them a sudden turn the whole dispositionof the words was entirely changed  he then commanded sixandthirty ofthe lads to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon theframe and where they found three or four words together that might makepart of a sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who werescribes  this work was repeated three or four times and at every turnthe engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places asthe square bits of wood moved upside down                           picture the framesix hours a day the young students were employed in this labour and theprofessor showed me several volumes in large folio already collected ofbroken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of thoserich materials to give the world a complete body of all arts andsciences which however might be still improved and much expedited ifthe public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred suchframes in lagado and oblige the managers to contribute in common theirseveral collectionshe assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from hisyouth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame and madethe strictest computation of the general proportion there is in booksbetween the numbers of particles nouns and verbs and other parts ofspeechi made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person for hisgreat communicativeness and promised if ever i had the good fortune toreturn to my native country that i would do him justice as the soleinventor of this wonderful machine the form and contrivance of which idesired leave to delineate on paper as in the figure here annexed  itold him although it were the custom of our learned in europe to stealinventions from each other who had thereby at least this advantage thatit became a controversy which was the right owner yet i would take suchcaution that he should have the honour entire without a rivalwe next went to the school of languages where three professors sat inconsultation upon improving that of their own countrythe first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllablesinto one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality allthings imaginable are but normsthe other project was a scheme for entirely abolishing all wordswhatsoever and this was urged as a great advantage in point of healthas well as brevity  for it is plain that every word we speak is insome degree a diminution of our lunge by corrosion and consequentlycontributes to the shortening of our lives  an expedient was thereforeoffered that since words are only names for things it would be moreconvenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessaryto express a particular business they are to discourse on  and thisinvention would certainly have taken place to the great ease as well ashealth of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar andilliterate had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might beallowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner oftheir forefathers such constant irreconcilable enemies to science arethe common people  however many of the most learned and wise adhere tothe new scheme of expressing themselves by things which has only thisinconvenience attending it that if a mans business be very great andof various kinds he must be obliged in proportion to carry a greaterbundle of things upon his back unless he can afford one or two strongservants to attend him  i have often beheld two of those sages almostsinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who whenthey met in the street would lay down their loads open their sacks andhold conversation for an hour together then put up their implementshelp each other to resume their burdens and take their leavebut for short conversations a man may carry implements in his pocketsand under his arms enough to supply him and in his house he cannot beat a loss  therefore the room where company meet who practise this artis full of all things ready at hand requisite to furnish matter forthis kind of artificial converseanother great advantage proposed by this invention was that it wouldserve as a universal language to be understood in all civilised nationswhose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearlyresembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended  and thusambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes orministers of state to whose tongues they were utter strangersi was at the mathematical school where the master taught his pupilsafter a method scarce imaginable to us in europe  the proposition anddemonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer with ink composed ofa cephalic tincture  this the student was to swallow upon a fastingstomach and for three days following eat nothing but bread and wateras the wafer digested the tincture mounted to his brain bearing theproposition along with it  but the success has not hitherto beenanswerable partly by some error in the quantum or composition andpartly by the perverseness of lads to whom this bolus

further account of the academy  the author proposes some improvementswhich are honourably receivedin the school of political projectors i was but ill entertained theprofessors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses whichis a scene that never fails to make me melancholy  these unhappy peoplewere proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites uponthe score of their wisdom capacity and virtue of teaching ministers toconsult the public good of rewarding merit great abilities eminentservices of instructing princes to know their true interest by placingit on the same foundation with that of their people of choosing foremployments persons qualified to exercise them with many other wildimpossible chimeras that never entered before into the heart of man toconceive and confirmed in me the old observation that there is nothingso extravagant and irrational which some philosophers have notmaintained for truthbut however i shall so far do justice to this part of the academy asto acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary  there was a mostingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole natureand system of government  this illustrious person had very usefullyemployed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseasesand corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration aresubject by the vices or infirmities of those who govern as well as bythe licentiousness of those who are to obey  for instance whereas allwriters and reasoners have agreed that there is a strict universalresemblance between the natural and the political body can there be anything more evident than that the health of both must be preserved andthe diseases cured by the same prescriptions  it is allowed thatsenates and great councils are often troubled with redundant ebullientand other peccant humours with many diseases of the head and more ofthe heart with strong convulsions with grievous contractions of thenerves and sinews in both hands but especially the right with spleenflatus vertigos and deliriums with scrofulous tumours full of fetidpurulent matter with sour frothy ructations with canine appetites andcrudeness of digestion besides many others needless to mention  thisdoctor therefore proposed that upon the meeting of the senate certainphysicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting and atthe close of each days debate feel the pulses of every senator afterwhich having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of theseveral maladies and the methods of cure they should on the fourth dayreturn to the senate house attended by their apothecaries stored withproper medicines and before the members sat administer to each of themlenitives aperitives abstersives corrosives restringentspalliatives laxatives cephalalgics icterics apophlegmaticsacoustics as their several cases required and according as thesemedicines should operate repeat alter or omit them at the nextmeetingthis project could not be of any great expense to the public and mightin my poor opinion be of much use for the despatch of business in thosecountries where senates have any share in the legislative power begetunanimity shorten debates open a few mouths which are now closed andclose many more which are now open curb the petulancy of the young andcorrect the positiveness of the old rouse the stupid and damp the pertagain because it is a general complaint that the favourites of princesare troubled with short and weak memories the same doctor proposedthat whoever attended a first minister after having told his businesswith the utmost brevity and in the plainest words should at hisdeparture give the said minister a tweak by the nose or a kick in thebelly or tread on his corns or lug him thrice by both ears or run apin into his breech or pinch his arm black and blue to preventforgetfulness and at every levee day repeat the same operation tillthe business were done or absolutely refusedhe likewise directed that every senator in the great council of anation after he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defence ofit should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary because if thatwere done the result would infallibly terminate in the good of thepublicwhen parties in a state are violent he offered a wonderful contrivanceto reconcile them  the method is this you take a hundred leaders ofeach party you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearestof a size then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each coupleat the same time in such a manner that the brain may be equally dividedlet the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged applying each to thehead of his opposite partyman  it seems indeed to be a work thatrequires some exactness but the professor assured us that if it weredexterously performed the cure would be infallible  for he arguedthus that the two half brains being left to debate the matter betweenthemselves within the space of one skull would soon come to a goodunderstanding and produce that moderation as well as regularity ofthinking so much to be wished for in the heads of those who imaginethey come into the world only to watch and govern its motion and as tothe difference of brains in quantity or quality among those who aredirectors in faction the doctor assured us from his own knowledge thatit was a perfect triflei heard a very warm debate between two professors about the mostcommodious and effectual ways and means of raising money withoutgrieving the subject  the first affirmed the justest method would beto lay a certain tax upon vices and folly and the sum fixed upon everyman to be rated after the fairest manner by a jury of his neighboursthe second was of an opinion directly contrary to tax those qualitiesof body and mind for which men chiefly value themselves the rate to bemore or less according to the degrees of excelling the decision whereofshould be left entirely to their own breast  the highest tax was uponmen who are the greatest favourites of the other sex and theassessments according to the number and nature of the favours they havereceived for which they are allowed to be their own vouchers  witvalour and politeness were likewise proposed to be largely taxed andcollected in the same manner by every persons giving his own word forthe quantum of what he possessed  but as to honour justice wisdom andlearning they should not be taxed at all because they arequalifications of so singular a kind that no man will either allow themin his neighbour or value them in himselfthe women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skillin dressing wherein they had the same privilege with the men to bedetermined by their own judgment  but constancy chastity good senseand good nature were not rated because they would not bear the chargeof collectingto keep senators in the interest of the crown it was proposed that themembers should raffle for employment every man first taking an oath andgiving security that he would vote for the court whether he won or notafter which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raffling uponthe next vacancy  thus hope and expectation would be kept alive nonewould complain of broken promises but impute their disappointmentswholly to fortune whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those ofa ministryanother professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discoveringplots and conspiracies against the government  he advised greatstatesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their timesof eating upon which side they lay in bed with which hand they wipetheir posteriors take a strict view of their excrements and from thecolour the odour the taste the consistence the crudeness or maturityof digestion form a judgment of their thoughts and designs because menare never so serious thoughtful and intent as when they are at stoolwhich he found by frequent experiment for in such conjunctures when heused merely as a trial to consider which was the best way of murderingthe king his ordure would have a tincture of green but quite differentwhen he thought only of raising an insurrection or burning themetropolisthe whole discourse was written with great acuteness containing manyobservations both curious and useful for politicians but as iconceived not altogether complete  this i ventured to tell the authorand offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions  hereceived my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writersespecially those of the projecting species professing he would be gladto receive further informationi told him that in the kingdom of tribnia a by the natives calledlangdon b where i had sojourned some time in my travels the bulkof the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnessesinformers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together withtheir several subservient and subaltern instruments all under thecolours the conduct and the pay of ministers of state and theirdeputies  the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship ofthose persons who desire to raise their own characters of profoundpoliticians to restore new vigour to a crazy administration to stifleor divert general discontents to fill their coffers with forfeituresand raise or sink the opinion of public credit as either shall bestanswer their private advantage  it is first agreed and settled amongthem what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot then effectualcare is taken to secure all their letters and papers and put the ownersin chains  these papers are delivered to a set of artists verydexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words syllables andletters for instance they can discover a close stool to signify aprivy council a flock of geese a senate a lame dog an invader theplague a standing army a buzzard a prime minister the gout a highpriest a gibbet a secretary of state a chamber pot a committee ofgrandees a sieve a court lady a broom a revolution a mousetrap anemployment a bottomless pit a treasury a sink a court a cap andbells a favourite a broken reed a court of justice an empty tun ageneral a running sore the administration when this method fails they have two others more effectual which thelearned among them call acrostics and anagrams  first they can decipherall initial letters into political meanings  thus n shall signify aplot b a regiment of horse l a fleet at sea or secondly bytransposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper they canlay open the deepest designs of a discontented party  so for exampleif i should say in a letter to a friend our brother tom has just gotthe piles a skilful decipherer would discover that the same letterswhich compose that sentence may be analysed into the following wordsresist  a plot is brought homethe tour  and this is theanagrammatic methodthe professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating theseobservations and promised to make honourable mention of me in histreatisei saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longercontinuance and began to think of returning home to englandchapter viithe author leaves lagado

eastward to that unknown tract of america westward ofcalifornia and north to the pacific ocean which is not above a hundredand fifty miles from lagado where there is a good port and muchcommerce with the great island of luggnagg situated to the northwestabout  degrees north latitude and  longitude  this island ofluggnagg stands southeastward of japan about a hundred leagues distantthere is a strict alliance between the japanese emperor and the king ofluggnagg which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one islandto the other  i determined therefore to direct my course this way inorder to my return to europe  i hired two mules with a guide to showme the way and carry my small baggage  i took leave of my nobleprotector who had shown me so much favour and made me a generouspresent at my departuremy journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating  when iarrived at the port of maldonada for so it is called there was no shipin the harbour bound for luggnagg nor likely to be in some time  thetown is about as large as portsmouth  i soon fell into someacquaintance and was very hospitably received  a gentleman ofdistinction said to me that since the ships bound for luggnagg couldnot be ready in less than a month it might be no disagreeable amusementfor me to take a trip to the little island of glubbdubdrib about fiveleagues off to the southwest  he offered himself and a friend toaccompany me and that i should be provided with a small convenient barkfor the voyageglubbdubdrib as nearly as i can interpret the word signifies the islandof sorcerers or magicians  it is about one third as large as the isle ofwight and extremely fruitful it is governed by the head of a certaintribe who are all magicians  this tribe marries only among each otherand the eldest in succession is prince or governor  he has a noblepalace and a park of about three thousand acres surrounded by a wall ofhewn stone twenty feet high  in this park are several small enclosuresfor cattle corn and gardeningthe governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of akind somewhat unusual  by his skill in necromancy he has a power ofcalling whom he pleases from the dead and commanding their service fortwentyfour hours but no longer nor can he call the same persons upagain in less than three months except upon very extraordinaryoccasionswhen we arrived at the island which was about eleven in the morning oneof the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desiredadmittance for a stranger who came on purpose to have the honour ofattending on his highness  this was immediately granted and we allthree entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards armedand dressed after a very antic manner and with something in theircountenances that made my flesh creep with a horror i cannot express  wepassed through several apartments between servants of the same sortranked on each side as before till we came to the chamber of presencewhere after three profound obeisances and a few general questions wewere permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of hishighnesss throne  he understood the language of balnibarbi although itwas different from that of this island  he desired me to give him someaccount of my travels and to let me see that i should be treatedwithout ceremony he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of hisfinger at which to my great astonishment they vanished in an instantlike visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden  i could not recovermyself in some time till the governor assured me that i should receiveno hurt and observing my two companions to be under no concern who hadbeen often entertained in the same manner i began to take courage andrelated to his highness a short history of my several adventures yet notwithout some hesitation and frequently looking behind me to the placewhere i had seen those domestic spectres  i had the honour to dine withthe governor where a new set of ghosts served up the meat and waited attable  i now observed myself to be less terrified than i had been in themorning  i stayed till sunset but humbly desired his highness to excuseme for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace  my twofriends and i lay at a private house in the town adjoining which is thecapital of this little island and the next morning we returned to payour duty to the governor as he was pleased to command usafter this manner we continued in the island for ten days most part ofevery day with the governor and at night in our lodging  i soon grew sofamiliarized to the sight of spirits that after the third or fourth timethey gave me no emotion at all or if i had any apprehensions left mycuriosity prevailed over them  for his highness the governor ordered meto call up whatever persons i would choose to name and in whatevernumbers among all the dead from the beginning of the world to thepresent time and command them to answer any questions i should think fitto ask with this condition that my questions must be confined withinthe compass of the times they lived in  and one thing i might dependupon that they would certainly tell me the truth for lying was a talentof no use in the lower worldi made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favourwe were in a chamber from whence there was a fair prospect into thepark  and because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenesof pomp and magnificence i desired to see alexander the great at thehead of his army just after the battle of arbela which upon a motionof the governors finger immediately appeared in a large field underthe window where we stood  alexander was called up into the room it waswith great difficulty that i understood his greek and had but little ofmy own  he assured me upon his honour that he was not poisoned butdied of a bad fever by excessive drinkingnext i saw hannibal passing the alps who told me he had not a drop ofvinegar in his campi saw csar and pompey at the head of their troops just ready to engagei saw the former in his last great triumph  i desired that the senateof rome might appear before me in one large chamber and an assembly ofsomewhat a later age in counterview in another  the first seemed to bean assembly of heroes and demigods the other a knot of pedlarspickpockets highwayman and bulliesthe governor at my request gave the sign for csar and brutus toadvance towards us  i was struck with a profound veneration at the sightof brutus and could easily discover the most consummate virtue thegreatest intrepidity and firmness of mind the truest love of hiscountry and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of hiscountenance  i observed with much pleasure that these two persons werein good intelligence with each other and csar freely confessed to methat the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by manydegrees to the glory of taking it away  i had the honour to have muchconversation with brutus and was told that his ancestor juniussocrates epaminondas cato the younger sir thomas more and himselfwere perpetually together a sextumvirate to which all the ages of theworld cannot add a seventhit would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbersof illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire ihad to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me  ichiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants andusurpers and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nationsbut it is impossible to express the satisfaction i received in my ownmind after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to thereaderchapter viiia further account of glubbdubdrib  ancient and modern history correctedhaving a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit andlearning i set apart one day on purpose  i proposed that homer andaristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but thesewere so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the courtand outward rooms of the palace  i knew and could distinguish those twoheroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each otherhomer was the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erectfor one of his age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing i everbeheld  aristotle stooped much and made use of a staff  his visage wasmeagre his hair lank and thin and his voice hollow  i soon discoveredthat both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company andhad never seen or heard of them before and i had a whisper from a ghostwho shall be nameless that these commentators always kept in the mostdistant quarters from their principals in the lower world through aconsciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horriblymisrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity  i introduceddidymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat thembetter than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted a geniusto enter into the spirit of a poet  but aristotle was out of allpatience with the account i gave him of scotus and ramus as i presentedthem to him and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were asgreat dunces as themselvesi then desired the governor to call up descartes and gassendi with whomi prevailed to explain their systems to aristotle  this greatphilosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophybecause he proceeded in many things upon conjecture as all men must doand he found that gassendi who had made the doctrine of epicurus aspalatable as he could and the vortices of descartes were equally to beexploded  he predicted the same fate to attraction whereof thepresent learned are such zealous asserters  he said that new systemsof nature were but new fashions which would vary in every age and eventhose who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principleswould flourish but a short period of time and be out of vogue when thatwas determinedi spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learnedi saw most of the first roman emperors  i prevailed on the governor tocall up heliogabaluss cooks to dress us a dinner but they could notshow us much of their skill for want of materials  a helot of agesilausmade us a dish of spartan broth but i was not able to get down a secondspoonfulthe two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by theirprivate affairs to return in three days which i employed in seeing someof the modern dead who had made the greatest figure for two or threehundred years past in our own and other countries of europe and havingbeen always a great admirer of old illustrious families i desired thegovernor would call up a dozen or two of kings with their ancestors inorder for eight or nine generations  but my disappointment was grievousand unexpected  for instead of a long train with royal diadems i sawin one family two fiddlers three spruce courtiers and an italianprelate  in another a barber an abbot and two cardinals  i have toogreat a veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice asubject  but as to counts marquises dukes earls and the like i wasnot so scrupulous  and i confess it was not without some pleasure thati found myself able to trace the particular features by which certainfamilies are distinguished up to their originals  i could plainlydiscover whence one family derives a long chin why a second has aboundedwith knaves for two generations and fools for two more why a thirdhappened to be crackbrained and a fourth to be sharpers whence itcame what polydore virgil says of a certain great house nec virfortis nec foemina casta how cruelty falsehood and cowardice grewto be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as muchas by their coats of arms who first brought the pox into a noble housewhich has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterityneither could i wonder at all this when i saw such an interruption oflineages by pages lackeys valets coachmen gamesters fiddlersplayers captains and pickpocketsi was chiefly disgusted with modern history  for having strictlyexamined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for ahundred years past i found how the world had been misled by prostitutewriters to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards the wisestcounsel to fools sincerity to flatterers roman virtue to betrayersof their country piety to atheists chastity to sodomites truth toinformers how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned todeath or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon thecorruption of judges and the malice of factions how many villains hadbeen exalted to the highest places of trust power dignity and profithow great a share in the motions and events of courts councils andsenates might be challenged by bawds whores pimps parasites andbuffoons  how low an opinion i had of human wisdom and integrity when iwas truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises andrevolutions in the world and of the contemptible accidents to which theyowed their successhere i discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to writeanecdotes or secret history who send so many kings to their graves witha cup of poison will repeat the discourse between a prince and chiefminister where no witness was by unlock the thoughts and cabinets ofambassadors and secretaries of state and have the perpetual misfortuneto be mistaken  here i discovered the true causes of many great eventsthat have surprised the world how a whore can govern the backstairsthe

corruptionbecause that positive confident restiff temper which virtue infusedinto a man was a perpetual clog to public businessi had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner by what methodsgreat numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour andprodigious estates and i confined my inquiry to a very modern periodhowever without grating upon present times because i would be sure togive no offence even to foreigners for i hope the reader need not betold that i do not in the least intend my own country in what i sayupon this occasion a great number of persons concerned were called upand upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamythat i cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness  perjuryoppression subornation fraud pandarism and the like infirmities wereamong the most excusable arts they had to mention and for these i gaveas it was reasonable great allowance  but when some confessed they owedtheir greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to theprostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betrayingof their country or their prince some to poisoning more to theperverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent i hope i may bepardoned if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of thatprofound veneration which i am naturally apt to pay to persons of highrank who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to theirsublime dignity by us their inferiorsi had often read of some great services done to princes and states anddesired to see the persons by whom those services were performed  uponinquiry i was told that their names were to be found on no recordexcept a few of them whom history has represented as the vilest ofrogues and traitors  as to the rest i had never once heard of themthey all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest habit most ofthem telling me they died in poverty and disgrace and the rest on ascaffold or a gibbetamong others there was one person whose case appeared a littlesingular  he had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his sidehe told me he had for many years been commander of a ship and in thesea fight at actium had the good fortune to break through the enemysgreat line of battle sink three of their capital ships and take afourth which was the sole cause of antonys flight and of the victorythat ensued that the youth standing by him his only son was killed inthe action  he added that upon the confidence of some merit the warbeing at an end he went to rome and solicited at the court of augustusto be preferred to a greater ship whose commander had been killed butwithout any regard to his pretensions it was given to a boy who hadnever seen the sea the son of libertina who waited on one of theemperors mistresses  returning back to his own vessel he was chargedwith neglect of duty and the ship given to a favourite page ofpublicola the viceadmiral whereupon he retired to a poor farm at agreat distance from rome and there ended his life  i was so curious toknow the truth of this story that i desired agrippa might be called whowas admiral in that fight  he appeared and confirmed the whole accountbut with much more advantage to the captain whose modesty had extenuatedor concealed a great part of his meriti was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in thatempire by the force of luxury so lately introduced which made me lesswonder at many parallel cases in other countries where vices of allkinds have reigned so much longer and where the whole praise as well aspillage has been engrossed by the chief commander who perhaps had theleast title to eitheras every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done inthe world it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the raceof human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years pasthow the pox under all its consequences and denominations had alteredevery lineament of an english countenance shortened the

furnish me with provisions and see me on board  i was amonth in this voyage  we had one violent storm and were under anecessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind which holdsfor above sixty leagues  on the st of april  we sailed into theriver of clumegnig which is a seaport town at the southeast point ofluggnagg  we cast anchor within a league of the town and made a signalfor a pilot  two of them came on board in less than half an hour bywhom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks which are verydangerous in the passage to a large basin where a fleet may ride insafety within a cables length of the townwallsome of our sailors whether out of treachery or inadvertence hadinformed the pilots that i was a stranger and great traveller whereofthese gave notice to a customhouse officer by whom i was examined verystrictly upon my landing  this officer spoke to me in the language ofbalnibarbi which by the force of much commerce is generally understoodin that town especially by seamen and those employed in the customs  igave him a short account of some particulars and made my story asplausible and consistent as i could but i thought it necessary todisguise my country and call myself a hollander because my intentionswere for japan and i knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted toenter into that kingdom  i therefore told the officer that having beenshipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi and cast on a rock i wasreceived up into laputa or the flying island of which he had oftenheard and was now endeavouring to get to japan whence i might find aconvenience of returning to my own country  the officer said i mustbe confined till he could receive orders from court for which he wouldwrite immediately and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight  i wascarried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the doorhowever i had the liberty of a large garden and was treated withhumanity enough being maintained all the time at the kings charge  iwas invited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it wasreported that i came from countries very remote of which they had neverheardi hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter hewas a native of luggnagg but had lived some years at maldonada and wasa perfect master of both languages  by his assistance i was able tohold a conversation with those who came to visit me but this consistedonly of their questions and my answersthe despatch came from court about the time we expected  it contained awarrant for conducting me and my retinue to

appoint a day and hourwhen it would by his gracious pleasure that i might have the honour tolick the dust before his footstool  this is the court style and ifound it to be more than matter of form for upon my admittance two daysafter my arrival i was commanded to crawl upon my belly and lick thefloor as i advanced but on account of my being a stranger care wastaken to have it made so clean that the dust was not offensivehowever this was a peculiar grace not allowed to any but persons of thehighest rank when they desire an admittance  nay sometimes the flooris strewed with dust on purpose when the person to be admitted happensto have powerful enemies at court and i have seen a great lord with hismouth so crammed that when he had crept to the proper distance from thethrone he was not able to speak a word  neither is there any remedybecause it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipetheir mouths in his majestys presence  there is indeed another customwhich i cannot altogether approve of when the king has a mind to put anyof his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner he commands thefloor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly compositionwhich being licked up infallibly kills him in twentyfour hours  but injustice to this princes great clemency and the care he has of hissubjects lives wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs ofeurope would imitate him it must be mentioned for his honour thatstrict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor wellwashed after every such execution which if his domestics neglect theyare in danger of incurring his royal displeasure  i myself heard himgive directions that one of his pages should be whipped whose turn itwas to give notice about washing the floor after an execution butmaliciously had omitted it by which neglect a young lord of great hopescoming to an audience was unfortunately poisoned although the king atthat time had no design against his life  but this good prince was sogracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping upon promise that hewould do so no more without special ordersto return from this digression  when i had crept within four

whereupon the youngman already mentioned was accordingly introduced by whose intervention ianswered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour  ispoke in the balnibarbian tongue and my interpreter delivered my meaningin that of luggnaggthe king was much delighted with my company and ordered hisbliffmarklub or highchamberlain to appoint a lodging in the courtfor me and my interpreter with a daily allowance for my table and alarge purse of gold for my common expensesi staid three months in this country out of perfect obedience to hismajesty who was pleased highly to favour me and made me very honourableoffers  but i thought it more consistent with prudence and justice topass the remainder of my days with my wife and familychapter xthe luggnaggians commended  a particular description of the struldbrugswith many conversations between the author and some eminent persons uponthat subjectthe luggnaggians are a polite and generous people and although they arenot without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all easterncountries yet they show themselves courteous to strangers especiallysuch who are countenanced by the court  i had many acquaintance andamong persons of the best fashion and being always attended by myinterpreter the conversation we had was not disagreeableone day in much good company i was asked by a person of qualitywhether i had seen any of their struldbrugs or immortals  i saidi had not and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such anappellation applied to a mortal creature  he told me that sometimesthough very rarely a child happened to be born in a family with a redcircular spot in the forehead directly over the left eyebrow which wasan infallible mark that it should never die  the spot as he describedit was about the compass of a silver threepence but in the course oftime grew larger and changed its colour for at twelve years old itbecame green so continued till five and twenty then turned to a deepblue at five and forty it grew coal black and as large as an englishshilling but never admitted any further alteration  he said thesebirths were so rare that he did not believe there could be above elevenhundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom of which hecomputed about fifty in the metropolis and among the rest a young girlborn about three years ago that these productions were not peculiar toany family but a mere effect of chance and the children of thestruldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of thepeoplei freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight uponhearing this account and the person who gave it me happening tounderstand the balnibarbian language which i spoke very well i couldnot forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little tooextravagant  i cried out as in a rapture happy nation where everychild hath at least a chance for being immortal  happy people who enjoyso many living examples of ancient virtue and have masters ready toinstruct them in the wisdom of all former ages but happiest beyond allcomparison are those excellent struldbrugs who being born exemptfrom that universal calamity of human nature have their minds free anddisengaged without the weight and depression of spirits caused by thecontinual apprehensions of death  i discovered my admiration that i hadnot observed any of these illustrious persons at court the black spot onthe forehead being so remarkable a distinction that i could not haveeasily overlooked it and it was impossible that his majesty a mostjudicious prince should not provide himself with a good number of suchwise and able counsellors  yet perhaps the virtue of those reverendsages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a courtand we often find by experience that young men are too opinionated andvolatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors  howeversince the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person i wasresolved upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him onthis matter freely and at large by the help of my interpreter andwhether he would please to take my advice or not yet in one thing i wasdetermined that his majesty having frequently offered me anestablishment in this country i would with great thankfulness acceptthe favour and pass my life here in the conversation of those superiorbeings the struldbrugs if they would please to admit methe gentleman to whom i addressed my discourse because as i havealready observed he spoke the language of balnibarbi said to me with asort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant that hewas glad of any occasion to keep me among them and desired my permissionto explain to the company what i had spoke  he did so and they talkedtogether for some time in their own language whereof i understood not asyllable neither could i observe by their countenances what impressionmy discourse had made on them  after a short silence the same persontold me that his friends and mine so he thought fit to expresshimself were very much pleased with the judicious remarks i had made onthe great happiness and advantages of immortal life and they weredesirous to know in a particular manner what scheme of living i shouldhave formed to myself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born astruldbrugi answered it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful asubject especially to me who had been often apt to amuse myself withvisions of what i should do if i were a king a general or a greatlord and upon this very case i had frequently run over the whole systemhow i should employ myself and pass the time if i were sure to live foreverthat if it had been my good fortune to come into the world astruldbrug as soon as i could discover my own happiness byunderstanding the difference between life and death i would firstresolve by all arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself richesin the pursuit of which by thrift and management i might reasonablyexpect in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in thekingdom  in the second place i would from my earliest youth applymyself to the study of arts and sciences by which i should arrive intime to excel all others in learning  lastly i would carefully recordevery action and event of consequence that happened in the publicimpartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes andgreat ministers of state with my own observations on every point  iwould exactly set down the several changes in customs language fashionsof dress diet and diversions  by all which acquirements i should be aliving treasure of knowledge and wisdom and certainly become the oracleof the nationi would never marry after threescore but live in a hospitable manneryet still on the saving side  i would entertain myself in forming anddirecting the minds of hopeful young men by convincing them from my ownremembrance experience and observation fortified by numerous examplesof the usefulness of virtue in public and private life  but my choiceand constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhoodamong whom i would elect a dozen from the most ancient down to my owncontemporaries  where any of these wanted fortunes i would provide themwith convenient lodges round my own estate and have some of them alwaysat my table only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortalswhom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctanceand treat your posterity after the same manner just as a man divertshimself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his gardenwithout regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding yearthese struldbrugs and i would mutually communicate our observationsand memorials through the course of time remark the several gradationsby which corruption steals into the world and oppose it in every stepby giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind which added tothe strong influence of our own example would probably prevent thatcontinual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all agesadd to this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of statesand empires the changes in the lower and upper world ancient cities inruins and obscure villages become the seats of kings famous riverslessening into shallow brooks the ocean leaving one coast dry andoverwhelming another the discovery of many countries yet unknownbarbarity overrunning the politest nations and the most barbarous becomecivilized  i should then see the discovery of the longitude theperpetual motion the universal medicine and many other greatinventions brought to the utmost perfectionwhat wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy by outliving andconfirming our own predictions by observing the progress and return ofcomets with the changes of motion in the sun moon and starsi enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endlesslife and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with  when i hadended and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before tothe rest of the company there was a good deal of talk among them in thelanguage of the country not without some laughter at my expense  atlast the same gentleman who had been my interpreter said he wasdesired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes which i had falleninto through the common imbecility of human nature and upon thatallowance was less answerable for them  that this breed of struldbrugswas peculiar to their country for there were no such people either inbalnibarbi or japan where he had the honour to be ambassador from hismajesty and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard tobelieve that the fact was possible and it appeared from my astonishmentwhen he first mentioned the matter to me that i received it as a thingwholly new and scarcely to be credited  that in the two kingdoms abovementioned where during his residence he had conversed very much heobserved long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind  thatwhoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other asstrongly as he could  that the oldest had still hopes of living one daylonger and looked on death as the greatest evil from which naturealways prompted him to retreat  only in this island of luggnagg theappetite for living was not so eager from the continual example of thestruldbrugs before their eyesthat the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjustbecause it supposed a perpetuity of youth health and vigour which noman could be so foolish to hope however extravagant he may be in hiswishes  that the question therefore was not whether a man would chooseto be always in the prime of youth attended with prosperity and healthbut how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantageswhich old age brings along with it  for although few men will avow theirdesires of being immortal upon such hard conditions yet in the twokingdoms before mentioned of balnibarbi and japan he observed thatevery man desired to put off death some time longer let it approach everso late and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly except hewere incited by the extremity of grief or torture  and he appealed tome whether in those countries i had travelled as well as my own i hadnot observed the same general dispositionafter this preface he gave me a particular account of the struldbrugsamong them  he said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirtyyears old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejectedincreasing in both till they came to fourscore  this he learned fromtheir own confession for otherwise there not being above two or threeof that species born in an age they were too few to form a generalobservation by  when they came to fourscore years which is reckoned theextremity of living in this country they had not only all the folliesand infirmities of other old men but many more which arose from thedreadful prospect of never dying  they were not only opinionativepeevish covetous morose vain talkative but incapable of friendshipand dead to all natural affection which never descended below theirgrandchildren  envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passionsbut those objects against which their envy seems principally directedare the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old  byreflecting on the former they find themselves cut off from allpossibility of pleasure and whenever they see a funeral they lament andrepine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which theythemselves never can hope to arrive  they have no remembrance ofanything but what they learned and observed in their youth andmiddleage and even that is very imperfect and for the truth orparticulars of any fact it is safer to depend on common tradition thanupon their best recollections  the least miserable among them appear tobe those who turn to dotage and entirely lose their memories these meetwith more pity and assistance because they want many bad qualities whichabound in othersif a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind the marriage isdissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as theyounger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it areasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without any fault oftheir own to a perpetual continuance in the world should not have theirmisery doubled by the load of a wifeas soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are lookedon as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their estates onlya small pittance is reserved for their support and the poor ones aremaintained at the public charge  after that period they are heldincapable of any employment of trust or profit they cannot purchaselands or take leases neither are they allowed to be witnesses in anycause either civil or criminal not even for the decision of meers andboundsat ninety they lose their teeth and hair they have at that age nodistinction of taste but eat and drink whatever they can get withoutrelish or appetite  the diseases they were subject to still continuewithout increasing or diminishing  in talking they forget the commonappellation of things and the names of persons even of those who aretheir nearest friends and relations  for the same reason they never canamuse themselves with reading because their memory will not serve tocarry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end and by thisdefect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they mightotherwise be capablethe language of this country being always upon the flux thestruldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither arethey able after two hundred years to hold any conversation fartherthan by a few general words with their neighbours the mortals and thusthey lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their owncountrythis was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as i canremember  i afterwards saw five or six of different ages the youngestnot above two hundred years old who were brought to me at several timesby some of my friends but although they were told that i was a greattraveller and had seen all the world they had not the least curiosityto ask me a question only desired i would give them slumskudask ora token of remembrance which is a modest way of begging to avoid thelaw that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by thepublic although indeed with a very scanty allowancethey are despised and hated by all sorts of people  when one of them isborn it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded veryparticularly so that you may know their age by consulting the registerwhich however has not been kept above a thousand years past or atleast has been destroyed by time or public disturbances  but the usualway of computing how old they are is by asking them what kings or greatpersons they can remember and then consulting history for infalliblythe last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they werefourscore years oldthey were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld and the women morehorrible than the men  besides the usual deformities in extreme old agethey acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their number ofyears which is not to be described and among half a dozen i soondistinguished which was the eldest although there was not above acentury or two between themthe reader will easily believe that from what i had hear and seen mykeen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated  i grew heartilyashamed of the pleasing visions i had formed and thought no tyrant couldinvent a death into which i would not run with pleasure from such alife  the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friendsupon this occasion and rallied me very pleasantly wishing i could senda couple of struldbrugs to my own country to arm our people againstthe fear of death but this it seems is forbidden by the fundamentallaws of the kingdom or else i should have been well content with thetrouble and expense of transporting themi could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to thestruldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as anyother country would be under the necessity of enacting in the likecircumstances  otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequence of oldage those immortals would in time become proprietors of the wholenation and engross the civil power which for want of abilities tomanage must end in the ruin of the publicchapter xithe author leaves luggnagg and sails to japan  from thence he returnsin a dutch ship to amsterdam and from amsterdam to englandi thought this account of the struldbrugs might be some entertainmentto the reader because it seems to be a little out of the common way atleast i do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels thathas come to my hands and if i am deceived my excuse must be that it isnecessary for travellers who describe the same country very often toagree in dwelling on the same particulars without deserving the censureof having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before themthere is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the greatempire of japan and it is very probable that the japanese authors mayhave given some account of the struldbrugs but my stay in japan was soshort and i was so entirely a stranger to the language that i was notqualified to make any inquiries  but i hope the dutch upon this noticewill be curious and able enough to supply my defectshis majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in hiscourt and finding me absolutely determined to return to my nativecountry was pleased to give me his license to depart and honoured mewith a letter of recommendation under his own hand to the emperor ofjapan  he likewise presented me with four hundred and fortyfour largepieces of gold this nation delighting in even numbers and a reddiamond which i sold in england for eleven hundred poundson the th of may  i took a solemn leave of his majesty and all myfriends  this prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct meto glanguenstald which is a royal port to the southwest part of theisland  in six days i found a vessel ready to carry me to japan andspent fifteen days in the voyage  we landed at a small porttown calledxamoschi situated on the southeast part of japan the town lies on thewestern point where there is a narrow strait leading northward intoalong arm of the sea upon the northwest part of which yedo themetropolis stands  at landing i showed the customhouse officers myletter from the king of luggnagg to his imperial majesty  they knew theseal perfectly well it was as broad as the palm of my hand  theimpression was a king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth  themagistrates of the town hearing of my letter received me as a publicminister  they provided me with carriages and servants and bore mycharges to yedo where i was admitted to an audience and delivered myletter which was opened with great ceremony and explained to theemperor by an interpreter who then gave me notice by his majestysorder that i should signify my request and whatever it were itshould be granted for the sake of his royal brother of luggnagg  thisinterpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with thehollanders  he soon conjectured by my countenance that i was aeuropean and therefore repeated his majestys commands in low dutchwhich he spoke perfectly well  i answered as i had before determinedthat i was a dutch merchant shipwrecked in a very remote countrywhence i had travelled by sea and land to luggnagg and then tookshipping for japan where i knew my countrymen often traded and withsome of these i hoped to get an opportunity of returning into europe itherefore most humbly entreated his royal favour to give order that ishould be conducted in safety to nangasac  to this i added anotherpetition that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg hismajesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed onmy countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix because i had been throwninto his kingdom by my misfortunes without any intention of tradingwhen this latter petition was interpreted to the emperor he seemed alittle surprised and said he believed i was the first of my countrymenwho ever made any scruple in this point and that he began to doubtwhether i was a real hollander or not but rather suspected i must be achristian  however for the reasons i had offered but chiefly togratify the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour he wouldcomply with the singularity of my humour but the affair must be managedwith dexterity and his officers should be commanded to let me pass asit were by forgetfulness  for he assured me that if the secret shouldbe discovered by my countrymen the dutch they would cut my throat in thevoyage  i returned my thanks by the interpreter for so unusual afavour and some troops being at that time on their march to nangasacthe commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither withparticular instructions about the business of the crucifixon the th day of june  i arrived at nangasac after a very longand troublesome journey  i soon fell into the company of some dutchsailors belonging to the amboyna of amsterdam a stout ship of  tonsi had lived long in holland pursuing my studies at leyden and i spokedutch well  the seamen soon knew whence i came last they were curiousto inquire into my voyages and course of life  i made up a story asshort and probable as i could but concealed the greatest part  i knewmany persons in holland  i was able to invent names for my parents whomi pretended to be obscure people in the province of gelderland  i wouldhave given the captain one theodorus vangrult what he pleased to askfor my voyage to holland but understanding i was a surgeon he wascontented to take half the usual rate on condition that i would servehim in the way of my calling  before we took shipping i was often askedby some of the crew whether i had performed the ceremony abovementioned  i evaded the question by general answers that i hadsatisfied the emperor and court in all particulars  however amalicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer and pointing to me toldhim i had not yet trampled on the crucifix but the other who hadreceived instructions to let me pass gave the rascal twenty strokes onthe shoulders with a bamboo after which i was no more troubled with suchquestionsnothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage  we sailed with a fairwind to the cape of good hope where we staid only to take in freshwater  on the th of april  we arrived safe at amsterdam havinglost only three men by sickness in the voyage and a fourth who fellfrom the foremast into the sea not far from the coast of guinea  fromamsterdam i soon after set sail for england in a small vessel belongingto that cityon the th of april we put in at the downs  i landed next morning andsaw once more my native country after an absence of five years and sixmonths complete  i went

at sea which however i couldexercise upon occasion i took a skilful young man of that calling onerobert purefoy into my ship  we set sail from portsmouth upon the thday of september  on the th we met with captain pocock ofbristol at teneriffe who was going to the bay of campechy to cutlogwood  on the th he was parted from us by a storm i heard since myreturn that his ship foundered and none escaped but one cabin boy  hewas an honest man and a good sailor but a little too positive in hisown opinions which was the cause of his destruction as it has been withseveral others for if he had followed my advice he might have been safeat home with his family at this time as well as myselfi had several men who died in my ship of calentures so that i was forcedto get recruits out of barbadoes and the leeward islands where itouched by the direction of the merchants who employed me which i hadsoon too much cause to repent for i found afterwards that most of themhad been buccaneers  i had fifty hands onboard and my orders were thati should trade with the indians in the southsea and make whatdiscoveries i could  these rogues whom i had picked up debauched myother men and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship and secureme which they did one morning rushing into my cabin and binding mehand and foot threatening to throw me overboard if i offered to stiri told them i was their prisoner and would submit  this they made meswear to do and then they unbound me only fastening one of my legs witha chain near my bed and placed a sentry at my door with his piececharged who was commanded to shoot me dead if i attempted my libertythey sent me own victuals and drink and took the government of the shipto themselves  their design was to turn pirates and plunder thespaniards which they could not do till they got more men  but firstthey resolved to sell the goods the ship and then go to madagascar forrecruits several among them having died since my confinement  theysailed many weeks and traded with the indians but i knew not whatcourse they took being kept a close prisoner in my cabin and expectingnothing less than to be murdered as they often threatened meupon the th day of may  one james welch came down to my cabin andsaid he had orders from the captain to set me ashore  i expostulatedwith him but in vain neither would he so much as tell me who their newcaptain was  they forced me into the longboat letting me put on mybest suit of clothes which were as good as new and take a small bundleof linen but no arms except my hanger and they were so civil as not tosearch my pockets into which i conveyed what money i had with someother little necessaries  they rowed about a league and then set medown on a strand  i desired them to tell me what country it was  theyall swore they knew no more than myself but said that the captainas they called him was resolved after they had sold the lading toget rid of me in the first place where they could discover land  theypushed off immediately advising me to make haste for fear of beingovertaken by the tide and so bade me farewellin this desolate condition i advanced forward and soon got upon firmground where i sat down on a bank to rest myself and consider what ihad best do  when i was a little refreshed i went up into the countryresolving to deliver myself to the first savages i should meet andpurchase my life from them by some bracelets glass rings and othertoys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages andwhereof i had some about me  the land was divided by long rows of treesnot regularly planted but naturally growing there was great plenty ofgrass and several fields of oats  i walked very circumspectly for fearof being surprised or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind or oneither side  i fell into a beaten road where i saw many tracts of humanfeet and some of cows but most of horses  at last i beheld severalanimals in a field and one or two of the same kind sitting in treestheir shape was very singular and deformed which a little discomposedme so that i lay down behind a thicket to observe them better  some ofthem coming forward near the place where i lay gave me an opportunity ofdistinctly marking their form  their heads and breasts were covered witha thick hair some frizzled and others lank they had beards like goatsand a long ridge of hair down their backs and the fore parts of theirlegs and feet but the rest of their bodies was bare so that i might seetheir skins which were of a brown buff colour  they had no tails norany hair at all on their buttocks except about the anus which ipresume nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on theground for this posture they used as well as lying down and oftenstood on their hind feet  they climbed high trees as nimbly as asquirrel for they had strong extended claws before and behindterminating in sharp points and hooked  they would often spring andbound and leap with prodigious agility  the females were not so largeas the males they had long lank hair on their heads but none on theirfaces nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of theirbodies except about the anus and pudenda  the dugs hung between theirfore feet and often reached almost to the ground as they walked  thehair of both sexes was of several colours brown red black and yellowupon the whole i never beheld in all my travels so disagreeable ananimal or one against which i naturally conceived so strong anantipathy  so that thinking i had seen enough full of contempt andaversion i got up and pursued the beaten road hoping it might directme to the cabin of some indian  i had not got far when i met one ofthese creatures full in my way and coming up directly to me  the uglymonster when he saw me distorted several ways every feature of hisvisage and stared as at an object he had never seen before thenapproaching nearer lifted up his forepaw whether out of curiosity ormischief i could not tell but i drew my hanger and gave him a good blowwith the flat side of it for i durst not strike with the edge fearingthe inhabitants might be provoked against me if they should come to knowthat i had killed or maimed any of their cattle  when the beast felt thesmart he drew back and roared so loud that a herd of at least fortycame flocking about me from the next field howling and making odiousfaces but i ran to the body of a tree and leaning my back against itkept them off by waving my hanger  several of this cursed brood gettinghold of the branches behind leaped up into the tree whence they beganto discharge their excrements on my head however i escaped pretty wellby sticking close to the stem of the tree but was almost stifled withthe filth which fell about me on every sidein the midst of this distress i observed them all to run away on asudden as fast as they could at which i ventured to leave the tree andpursue the road wondering what it was that could put them into thisfright  but looking on my left hand i saw a horse walking softly in thefield which my persecutors having sooner discovered was the cause oftheir flight  the horse started a little when he came near me but soonrecovering himself looked full in my face with manifest tokens ofwonder he viewed my hands and feet walking round me several times  iwould have pursued my journey but he placed himself directly in the wayyet looking with a very mild aspect never offering the least violencewe stood gazing at each other for some time at last i took the boldnessto reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it using thecommon style and whistle of jockeys when they are going to handle astrange horse  but this animal seemed to receive my civilities withdisdain shook his head and bent his brows softly raising up his rightforefoot to remove my hand  then he neighed three or four times but inso different a cadence that i almost began to think he was speaking tohimself in some language of his ownwhile he and i were thus employed another horse came up who applyinghimself to the first in a very formal manner they gently struck eachothers right hoof before neighing several times by turns and varyingthe sound which seemed to be almost articulate  they went some pacesoff as if it were to confer together walking side by side backward andforward like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight but oftenturning their eyes towards me as it were to watch that i might notescape  i was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beastsand concluded with myself that if the inhabitants of this country wereendued with a proportionable degree of reason they must needs be thewisest people upon earth  this thought gave me so much comfort that iresolved to go forward until i could discover some house or village ormeet with any of the natives leaving the two horses to discoursetogether as they pleased  but the first who was a dapple grayobserving me to steal off neighed after me in so expressive a tone thati fancied myself to understand what he meant whereupon i turned backand came near to him to expect his farther commands but concealing myfear as much as i could for i began to be in some pain how thisadventure might terminate and the reader will easily believe i did notmuch like my present situationthe two horses came up close to me looking with great earnestness uponmy face and hands  the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his rightforehoof and discomposed it so much that i was forced to adjust itbetter by taking it off and settling it again whereat both he and hiscompanion who was a brown bay appeared to be much surprised the latterfelt the lappet of my coat and finding it to hang loose about me theyboth looked with new signs of wonder  he stroked my right hand seemingto admire the softness and colour but he squeezed it so hard between hishoof and his pastern that i was forced to roar after which they bothtouched me with all possible tenderness  they were under greatperplexity about my shoes and stockings which they felt very oftenneighing to each other and using various gestures not unlike those of aphilosopher when he would attempt to solve some new and difficultphenomenonupon the whole the behaviour of these animals was so orderly andrational so acute and judicious that i at last concluded they mustneeds be magicians who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon somedesign and seeing a stranger in the way resolved to divert themselveswith him or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of a man so verydifferent in habit feature and complexion from those who mightprobably live in so remote a climate  upon the strength of thisreasoning i ventured to address them in the following mannergentlemen if you be conjurers as i have good cause to believe you canunderstand my language therefore i make bold to let your worships knowthat i am a poor distressed englishman driven by his misfortunes uponyour coast and i entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back as ifhe were a real horse to some house or village where i can be relievedin return of which favour i will make you a present of this knife andbracelet taking them out of my pocket  the two creatures stood silentwhile i spoke seeming to listen with great attention and when i hadended they neighed frequently towards each other as if they wereengaged in serious conversation  i plainly observed that their languageexpressed the passions very well and the words might with little painsbe resolved into an alphabet more easily than the chinesei could frequently distinguish the word yahoo which was repeated byeach of them several times and although it was impossible for me toconjecture what it meant yet while the two horses were busy inconversation i endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue and assoon as they were silent i boldly pronounced yahoo in a loud voiceimitating at the same time as near as i could the neighing of a horseat which they were both visibly surprised and the gray repeated the sameword twice as if he meant to teach me the right accent wherein i spokeafter him as well as i could and found myself perceivably to improveevery time though very far from any degree of perfection  then the baytried me with a second word much harder to be pronounced but reducingit to the english orthography may be spelt thus houyhnhnm  i did notsucceed in this so well as in the former but after two or three farthertrials i had better fortune and they both appeared amazed at mycapacityafter some further discourse which i then conjectured might relate tome the two friends took their leaves with the same compliment ofstriking each others hoof and the gray made me signs that i should walkbefore him wherein i thought it prudent to comply till i could find abetter director  when i offered to slacken my pace he would cry hhuunhhuun i guessed his meaning and gave him to understand as well as icould that i was weary and not able to walk faster upon which hewould stand awhile to let me restchapter iithe author conducted by a houyhnhnm to his house  the house describedthe authors reception  the food of the houyhnhnms  the author indistress for want of meat  is at last relieved  his manner of feedingin this countryhaving travelled about three miles we came to a long kind of buildingmade of timber stuck in the ground and wattled across the roof was lowand covered with straw  i now began to be a little comforted and tookout some toys which travellers usually carry for presents to the savageindians of america and other parts in hopes the people of the housewould be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly  the horse made me asign to go in first it was a large room with a smooth clay floor and arack and manger extending the whole length on one side  there werethree nags and two mares not eating but some of them sitting down upontheir hams which i very much wondered at but wondered more to see therest employed in domestic business these seemed but ordinary cattlehowever this confirmed my first opinion that a people who could so farcivilise brute animals must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of theworld  the gray came in just after and thereby prevented any illtreatment which the others might have given me  he neighed to themseveral times in a style of authority and received answersbeyond this room there were three others reaching the length of thehouse to which you passed through three doors opposite to each otherin the manner of a vista  we went through the second room towards thethird  here the gray walked in first beckoning me to attend i waitedin the second room and got ready my presents for the master and mistressof the house they were two knives three bracelets of false pearls asmall lookingglass and a bead necklace  the horse neighed three orfour times and i waited to hear some answers in a human voice but iheard no other returns than in the same dialect only one or two a littleshriller than his  i began to think that this house must belong to someperson of great note among them because there appeared so much ceremonybefore i could gain admittance  but that a man of quality should beserved all by horses was beyond my comprehension  i feared my brain wasdisturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes  i roused myself and lookedabout me in the room where i was left alone this was furnished like thefirst only after a more elegant manner  i rubbed my eyes often but thesame objects still occurred  i pinched my arms and sides to awakemyself hoping i might be in a dream  i then absolutely concluded thatall these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magicbut i had no time to pursue these reflections for the gray horse came tothe door and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where isaw a very comely mare together with a colt and foal sitting on theirhaunches upon mats of straw not unartfully made and perfectly neat andcleanthe mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat and coming up closeafter having nicely observed my hands and face gave me a mostcontemptuous look and turning to the horse i heard the word yahoooften repeated betwixt them the meaning of which word i could not thencomprehend although it was the first i had learned to pronounce  but iwas soon better informed to my everlasting mortification for the horsebeckoning to me with his head and repeating the hhuun hhuun as hedid upon the road which i understood was to attend him led me out intoa kind of court where was another building at some distance from thehouse  here we entered and i saw three of those detestable creatureswhich i first met after my landing feeding upon roots and the flesh ofsome animals which i afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs andnow and then a cow dead by accident or disease  they were all tied bythe neck with strong withes fastened to a beam they held their foodbetween the claws of their fore feet and tore it with their teeththe master horse ordered a sorrel nag one of his servants to untie thelargest of these animals and take him into the yard  the beast and iwere brought close together and by our countenances diligently comparedboth by master and servant who thereupon repeated several times the wordyahoo  my horror and astonishment are not to be described when iobserved in this abominable animal a perfect human figure the face ofit indeed was flat and broad the nose depressed the lips large and themouth wide but these differences are common to all savage nations wherethe lineaments of the countenance are distorted by the natives sufferingtheir infants to lie grovelling on the earth or by carrying them ontheir backs nuzzling with their face against the mothers shouldersthe forefeet of the yahoo differed from my hands in nothing else butthe length of the nails the coarseness and brownness of the palms andthe hairiness on the backs  there was the same resemblance between ourfeet with the same differences which i knew very well though thehorses did not because of my shoes and stockings the same in every partof our bodies except as to hairiness and colour which i have alreadydescribedthe great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses was to seethe rest of my body so very different from that of a yahoo for which iwas obliged to my clothes whereof they had no conception  the sorrelnag offered me a root which he held after their manner as we shalldescribe in its proper place between his hoof and pastern i took it inmy hand and having smelt it returned it to him again as civilly as icould  he brought out of the yahoos kennel a piece of asss fleshbut it smelt so offensively that i turned from it with loathing he thenthrew it to the yahoo by whom it was greedily devoured  he afterwardsshowed me a wisp of hay and a fetlock full of oats but i shook my headto signify that neither of these were food for me  and indeed i nowapprehended that i must absolutely starve if i did not get to some of myown species for as to those filthy yahoos although there were fewgreater lovers of mankind at that time than myself yet i confess i neversaw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts and the more icame near them the more hateful they grew while i stayed in thatcountry  this the master horse observed by my behaviour and thereforesent the yahoo back to his kennel  he then put his forehoof to hismouth at which i was much surprised although he did it with ease andwith a motion that appeared perfectly natural and made other signs toknow what i would eat but i could not return him such an answer as hewas able to apprehend and if he had understood me i did not see how itwas possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment  whilewe were thus engaged i observed a cow passing by whereupon i pointed toher and expressed a desire to go and milk her  this had its effect forhe led me back into the house and ordered a mareservant to open a roomwhere a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels after avery orderly and cleanly manner  she gave me a large bowlful of which idrank very heartily and found myself well refreshedabout noon i saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like asledge by four yahoos  there was in it an old steed who seemed to beof quality he alighted with his hindfeet forward having by accidentgot a hurt in his left forefoot  he came to dine with our horse whoreceived him with great civility  they dined in the best room and hadoats boiled in milk for the second course which the old horse ate warmbut the rest cold  their mangers were placed circular in the middle ofthe room and divided into several partitions round which they sat ontheir haunches upon bosses of straw  in the middle was a large rackwith angles answering to every partition of the manger so that eachhorse and mare ate their own hay and their own mash of oats and milkwith much decency and regularity  the behaviour of the young colt andfoal appeared very modest and that of the master and mistress extremelycheerful and complaisant to their guest  the gray ordered me to stand byhim and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning meas i found by the strangers often looking on me and the frequentrepetition of the word yahooi happened to wear my gloves which the master gray observing seemedperplexed discovering signs of wonder what i had done to my forefeethe put his hoof three or four times to them as if he would signify thati should reduce them to their former shape which i presently didpulling off both my gloves and putting them into my pocket  thisoccasioned farther talk and i saw the company was pleased with mybehaviour whereof i soon found the good effects  i was ordered to speakthe few words i understood and while they were at dinner the mastertaught me the names for oats milk fire water and some others which icould readily pronounce after him having from my youth a great facilityin learning languageswhen dinner was done the master horse took me aside and by signs andwords made me understand the concern he was in that i had nothing to eatoats in their tongue are called hlunnh  this word i pronounced two orthree times for although i had refused them at first yet upon secondthoughts i considered that i could contrive to make of them a kind ofbread which might be sufficient with milk to keep me alive till icould make my escape to some other country and to creatures of my ownspecies  the horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of hisfamily to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden traythese i heated before the fire as well as i could and rubbed them tillthe husks came off which i made a shift to winnow from the grain  iground and beat them between two stones then took water and made theminto a paste or cake which i toasted at the fire and eat warm with milkit was at first a very insipid diet though common enough in many partsof europe but grew tolerable by time and having been often reduced tohard fare in my life this was not the first experiment i had made howeasily nature is satisfied  and i cannot but observe that i never hadone hours sickness while i stayed in this island  it is true isometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit or bird by springs made ofyahoos hairs and i often gathered wholesome herbs which i boiledand ate as salads with my bread and now and then for a rarity i made alittle butter and drank the whey  i was at first at a great loss forsalt but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it and i am confidentthat the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury and wasfirst introduced only as a provocative to drink except where it isnecessary for preserving flesh in long voyages or in places remote fromgreat markets for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man and asto myself when i left this country it was a great while before i couldendure the taste of it in anything that i atethis is enough to say upon the subject of my diet wherewith othertravellers fill their books as if the readers were personally concernedwhether we fare well or ill  however it was necessary to mention thismatter lest the world should think it impossible that i could findsustenance for three years in such a country and among such inhabitantswhen it grew towards evening the master horse ordered a place for me tolodge in it was but six yards from the house and separated from thestable of the yahoos  here i got some straw and covering myself withmy own clothes slept very sound  but i was in a short time betteraccommodated as the reader shall know hereafter when i come to treatmore particularly about my way of livingchapter iiithe author studies to learn the language  the houyhnhnm his masterassists in teaching him  the language described  several houyhnhnms ofquality come out of curiosity to see the author  he gives his master ashort account of his voyagemy principal endeavour was to learn the language which my master for soi shall henceforth call him and his children and every servant of hishouse were desirous to teach me for they looked upon it as a prodigythat a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature  ipointed to every thing and inquired the name of it which i wrote downin my journalbook when i was alone and corrected my bad accent bydesiring those of the family to pronounce it often  in this employmenta sorrel nag one of the underservants was very ready to assist mein speaking they pronounced through the nose and throat and theirlanguage approaches nearest to the highdutch or german of any i knowin europe but is much more graceful and significant  the emperorcharles v made almost the same observation when he said that if hewere to speak to his horse it should be in highdutchthe curiosity and impatience of my master were so great that he spentmany hours of his leisure to instruct me  he was convinced as heafterwards told me that i must be a yahoo but my teachablenesscivility and cleanliness astonished him which were qualitiesaltogether opposite to those animals  he was most perplexed about myclothes reasoning sometimes with himself whether they were a part of mybody for i never pulled them off till the family were asleep and gotthem on before they waked in the morning  my master was eager to learnwhence i came how i acquired those appearances of reason which idiscovered in all my actions and to know my story from my own mouthwhich he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency i made inlearning and pronouncing their words and sentences  to help my memoryi formed all i learned into the english alphabet and writ the wordsdown with the translations  this last after some time i ventured todo in my masters presence  it cost me much trouble to explain to himwhat i was doing for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books orliteraturein about ten weeks time i was able to understand most of his questionsand in three months could give him some tolerable answers  he wasextremely curious to know from what part of the country i came and howi was taught to imitate a rational creature because the yahoos whomhe saw i exactly resembled in my head hands and face that were onlyvisible with some appearance of cunning and the strongest dispositionto mischief were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes  ianswered that i came over the sea from a far place with many othersof my own kind in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of treesthat my companions forced me to land on this coast and then left me toshift for myself  it was with some difficulty and by the help of manysigns that i brought him to understand me  he replied that i mustneeds be mistaken or that i said the thing which was not for they haveno word in their language to express lying or falsehood  he knew it wasimpossible that there could be a country beyond the sea or that a parcelof brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water  hewas sure no houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel nor would trustyahoos to manage itthe word houyhnhnm in their tongue signifies a horse and in itsetymology the perfection of nature  i told my master that i was ata loss for expression but would improve as fast as i could and hopedin a short time i should be able to tell him wonders  he was pleasedto direct his own mare his colt and foal and the servants of thefamily to take all opportunities of instructing me and every day fortwo or three hours he was at the same pains himself  several horses andmares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house upon thereport spread of a wonderful yahoo that could speak like ahouyhnhnm and seemed in his words and actions to discover someglimmerings of reason  these delighted to converse with me they putmany questions and received such answers as i was able to return  byall these advantages i made so great a progress that in five monthsfrom my arrival i understood whatever was spoken and could expressmyself tolerably wellthe houyhnhnms who came to visit my master out of a design of seeingand talking with me could hardly believe me to be a right yahoobecause my body had a different covering from others of my kind  theywere astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin except onmy head face and hands but i discovered that secret to my master uponan accident which happened about a fortnight beforei have already told the reader that every night when the family weregone to bed it was my custom to strip and cover myself with my clothesit happened one morning early that my master sent for me by the sorrelnag who was his valet  when he came i was fast asleep my clothesfallen off on one side and my shirt above my waist  i awaked at thenoise he made and observed him to deliver his message in some disorderafter which he went to my master and in a great fright gave him a veryconfused account of what he had seen  this i presently discovered forgoing as soon as i was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour heasked me the meaning of what his servant had reported that i was notthe same thing when i slept as i appeared to be at other times that hisvale assured him some part of me was white some yellow at least not sowhite and some browni had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress in order to distinguishmyself as much as possible from that cursed race of yahoos but now ifound it in vain to do so any longer  besides i considered that myclothes and shoes would soon wear out which already were in a decliningcondition and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides ofyahoos or other brutes whereby the whole secret would be known  itherefore told my master that in the country whence i came those of mykind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animalsprepared by art as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of airboth hot and cold of which as to my own person i would give himimmediate conviction if he pleased to command me only desiring hisexcuse if i did not expose those parts that nature taught us toconceal  he said my discourse was all very strange but especiallythe last part for he could not understand why nature should teach us toconceal what nature had given that neither himself nor family wereashamed of any parts of their bodies but however i might do as ipleased  whereupon i first unbuttoned my coat and pulled it off  idid the same with my waistcoat  i drew off my shoes stockings andbreeches  i let my shirt down to my waist and drew up the bottomfastening it like a girdle about my middle to hide my nakednessmy master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosityand admiration  he took up all my clothes in his pastern one pieceafter another and examined them diligently he then stroked my body verygently and looked round me several times after which he said it wasplain i must be a perfect yahoo but that i differed very much from therest of my species in the softness whiteness and smoothness of my skinmy want of hair in several parts of my body the shape and shortness ofmy claws behind and before and my affectation of walking continually onmy two hinder feet  he desired to see no more and gave me leave to puton my clothes again for i was shuddering with coldi expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation ofyahoo an odious animal for which i had so utter a hatred andcontempt i begged he would forbear applying that word to me and makethe same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered tosee me  i requested likewise that the secret of my having a falsecovering to my body might be known to none but himself at least as longas my present clothing should last for as to what the sorrel nag hisvalet had observed his honour might command him to conceal itall this my master very graciously consented to and thus the secret waskept till my clothes began to wear out which i was forced to supply byseveral contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned  in the meantimehe desired i would go on with my utmost diligence to learn theirlanguage because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech andreason than at the figure of my body whether it were covered or notadding that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which ipromised to tell himthenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me hebrought me into all company and made them treat me with civilitybecause as he told them privately this would put me into goodhumour and make me more divertingevery day when i waited on him beside the trouble he was at inteaching he would ask me several questions concerning myself which ianswered as well as i could and by these means he had already receivedsome general ideas though very imperfect  it would be tedious to relatethe several steps by which i advanced to a more regular conversation butthe first account i gave of myself in any order and length was to thispurposethat i came from a very far country as i already had attempted to tellhim with about fifty more of my own species that we travelled upon theseas in a great hollow vessel made of wood and larger than his honourshouse  i described the ship to him in the best terms i could andexplained by the help of my handkerchief displayed how it was drivenforward by the wind  that upon a quarrel among us i was set on shore onthis coast where i walked forward without knowing whither till hedelivered me from the persecution of those execrable yahoos  he askedme who made the ship and how it was possible that the houyhnhnms ofmy country would leave it to the management of brutes  my answer wasthat i durst proceed no further in my relation unless he would give mehis word and honour that he would not be offended and then i would tellhim the wonders i had so often promised  he agreed and i went on byassuring him that the ship was made by creatures like myself who inall the countries i had travelled as well as in my own were the onlygoverning rational animals and that upon my arrival hither i was asmuch astonished to see the houyhnhnms act like rational beings as heor his friends could be in finding some marks of reason in a creaturehe was pleased to call a yahoo to which i owned my resemblance inevery part but could not account for their degenerate and brutal naturei said farther that if good fortune ever restored me to my nativecountry to relate my travels hither as i resolved to do everybodywould believe that i said the thing that was not that i invented thestory out of my own head and with all possible respect to himself hisfamily and friends and under his promise of not being offended ourcountrymen would hardly think it probable that a houyhnhnm should bethe presiding creature of a nation and a yahoo the brutechapter ivthe houyhnhnms notion of truth and falsehood  the authors discoursedisapproved by his master  the author gives a more particular account ofhimself and the accidents of his voyagemy master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in hiscountenance because doubting or not believing are so little known inthis country that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselvesunder such circumstances  and i remember in frequent discourses with mymaster concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the worldhaving occasion to talk of lying and false representation it was withmuch difficulty that he comprehended what i meant although he hadotherwise a most acute judgment  for he argued thus that the use ofspeech was to make us understand one another and to receive informationof facts now if any one said the thing which was not these ends weredefeated because i cannot properly be said to understand him and i amso far from receiving information that he leaves me worse than inignorance for i am led to believe a thing black when it is white andshort when it is long  and these were all the notions he hadconcerning that faculty of lying so perfectly well understood and souniversally practised among human creaturesto return from this digression  when i asserted that the yahoos werethe only governing animals in my country which my master said wasaltogether past his conception he desired to know whether we hadhouyhnhnms among us and what was their employment  i told him wehad great numbers that in summer they grazed in the fields and inwinter were kept in houses with hay and oats where yahoo servants wereemployed to rub their skins smooth comb their manes pick their feetserve them with food and make their beds  i understand you wellsaid my master it is now very plain from all you have spoken thatwhatever share of reason the yahoos pretend to the houyhnhnms areyour masters i heartily wish our yahoos would be so tractable  ibegged his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any furtherbecause i was very certain that the account he expected from me would behighly displeasing  but he insisted in commanding me to let him knowthe best and the worst  i told him he should be obeyed  i owned thatthe houyhnhnms among us whom we called horses were the most generousand comely animals we had that they excelled in strength and swiftnessand when they belonged to persons of quality were employed intravelling racing or drawing chariots they were treated with muchkindness and care till they fell into diseases or became foundered inthe feet but then they were sold and used to all kind of drudgery tillthey died after which their skins were stripped and sold for what theywere worth and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds ofprey  but the common race of horses had not so good fortune being keptby farmers and carriers and other mean people who put them to greaterlabour and fed them worse  i described as well as i could our way ofriding the shape and use of a bridle a saddle a spur and a whip ofharness and wheels  i added that we fastened plates of a certain hardsubstance called iron at the bottom of their feet to preserve theirhoofs from being broken by the stony ways on which we often travelledmy master after some expressions of great indignation wondered how wedared to venture upon a houyhnhnms back for he was sure that theweakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongestyahoo or by lying down and rolling on his back squeeze the brute todeath  i answered that our horses were trained up from three or fouryears old to the several uses we intended them for that if any of themproved intolerably vicious they were employed for carriages that theywere severely beaten while they were young for any mischievous tricksthat the males designed for the common use of riding or draught weregenerally castrated about two years after their birth to take down theirspirits and make them more tame and gentle that they were indeedsensible of rewards and punishments but his honour would please toconsider that they had not the least tincture of reason any more thanthe yahoos in this countryit put me to the pains of many circumlocutions to give my master a rightidea of what i spoke for their language does not abound in variety ofwords because their wants and passions are fewer than among us  but itis impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment ofthe houyhnhnm race particularly after i had explained the manner anduse of castrating horses among us to hinder them from propagating theirkind and to render them more servile  he said if it were possiblethere could be any country where yahoos alone were endued with reasonthey certainly must be the governing animal because reason in time willalways prevail against brutal strength  but considering the frame ofour bodies and especially of mine he thought no creature of equal bulkwas so illcontrived for employing that reason in the common offices oflife whereupon he desired to know whether those among whom i livedresembled me or the yahoos of his country  i assured him that iwas as well shaped as most of my age but the younger and the femaleswere much more soft and tender and the skins of the latter generally aswhite as milk  he said i differed indeed from other yahoos beingmuch more cleanly and not altogether so deformed but in point of realadvantage he thought i differed for the worse that my nails were of nouse either to my fore or hinder feet as to my fore feet he could notproperly call them by that name for he never observed me to walk uponthem that they were too soft to bear the ground that i generally wentwith them uncovered neither was the covering i sometimes wore on them ofthe same shape or so strong as that on my feet behind that i could notwalk with any security for if either of my hinder feet slipped i mustinevitably fail  he then began to find fault with other parts of mybody the flatness of my face the prominence of my nose mine eyesplaced directly in front so that i could not look on either side withoutturning my head that i was not able to feed myself without lifting oneof my forefeet to my mouth and therefore nature had placed those jointsto answer that necessity  he knew not what could be the use of thoseseveral clefts and divisions in my feet behind that these were too softto bear the hardness and sharpness of stones without a covering madefrom the skin of some other brute that my whole body wanted a fenceagainst heat and cold which i was forced to put on and off every daywith tediousness and trouble and lastly that he observed every animalin this country naturally to abhor the yahoos whom the weaker avoidedand the stronger drove from them  so that supposing us to have the giftof reason he could not see how it were possible to cure that naturalantipathy which every creature discovered against us nor consequentlyhow we could tame and render them serviceable  however he would as hesaid debate the matter no farther because he was more desirous to knowmy own story the country where i was born and the several actions andevents of my life before i came hitheri assured him how extremely desirous i was that he should be satisfiedon every point but i doubted much whether it would be possible for meto explain myself on several subjects whereof his honour could have noconception because i saw nothing in his country to which i couldresemble them that however i would do my best and strive to expressmyself by similitudes humbly desiring his assistance when i wantedproper words which he was pleased to promise mei said my birth was of honest parents in an island called englandwhich was remote from his country as many days journey as the strongestof his honours servants could travel in the annual course of the sunthat i was bred a surgeon whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts inthe body gotten by accident or violence that my country was governed bya female man whom we called queen that i left it to get riches wherebyi might maintain myself and family when i should return that in mylast voyage i was commander of the ship and had about fifty yahoosunder me many of which died at sea and i was forced to supply them byothers picked out from several nations that our ship was twice in dangerof being sunk the first time by a great storm and the second bystriking against a rock  here my master interposed by asking me howi could persuade strangers out of different countries to venture withme after the losses i had sustained and the hazards i had run  isaid they were fellows of desperate fortunes forced to fly from theplaces of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes  somewere undone by lawsuits others spent all they had in drinking whoringand gaming others fled for treason many for murder theft poisoningrobbery perjury forgery coining false money for committing rapes orsodomy for flying from their colours or deserting to the enemy andmost of them had broken prison none of these durst return to theirnative countries for fear of being hanged or of starving in a jail andtherefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in otherplacesduring this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me severaltimes  i had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him thenature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forcedto fly their country  this labour took up several days conversationbefore he was able to comprehend me  he was wholly at a loss to knowwhat could be the use or necessity of practising those vices  to clearup which i endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power andriches of the terrible effects of lust intemperance malice and envyall this i was forced to define and describe by putting cases and makingsuppositions  after which like one whose imagination was struck withsomething never seen or heard of before he would lift up his eyes withamazement and indignation  power government war law punishment anda thousand other things had no terms wherein that language could expressthem which made the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master anyconception of what i meant  but being of an excellent understandingmuch improved by contemplation and converse he at last arrived at acompetent knowledge of what human nature in our parts of the world iscapable to perform and desired i would give him some particular accountof that land which we call europe but especially of my own countrychapter vthe author at his masters command informs him of the state of englandthe causes of war among the princes of europe  the author begins toexplain the english constitutionthe reader may please to observe that the following extract of manyconversations i had with my master contains a summary of the mostmaterial points which were discoursed at several times for above twoyears his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction as i fartherimproved in the houyhnhnm tongue  i laid before him as well as icould the whole state of europe i discoursed of trade and manufacturesof arts and sciences and the answers i gave to all the questions hemade as they arose upon several subjects were a fund of conversationnot to be exhausted  but i shall here only set down the substance ofwhat passed between us concerning my own country reducing it in order aswell as i can without any regard to time or other circumstances while istrictly adhere to truth  my only concern is that i shall hardly beable to do justice to my masters arguments and expressions which mustneeds suffer by my want of capacity as well as by a translation into ourbarbarous englishin obedience therefore to his honours commands i related to him therevolution under the prince of orange the long war with france enteredinto by the said prince and renewed by his successor the present queenwherein the greatest powers of christendom were engaged and which stillcontinued i computed at his request that about a million of yahoosmight have been killed in the whole progress of it and perhaps a hundredor more cities taken and five times as many ships burnt or sunkhe asked me what were the usual causes or motives that made one countrygo to war with another  i answered they were innumerable but i shouldonly mention a few of the chief  sometimes the ambition of princes whonever think they have land or people enough to govern sometimes thecorruption of ministers who engage their master in a war in order tostifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their eviladministration  difference in opinions has cost many millions of livesfor instance whether flesh be bread or bread be flesh whether thejuice of a certain berry be blood or wine whether whistling be a vice ora virtue whether it be better to kiss a post or throw it into the firewhat is the best colour for a coat whether black white red or grayand whether it should be long or short narrow or wide dirty or cleanwith many more  neither are any wars so furious and bloody or of solong a continuance as those occasioned by difference in opinionespecially if it be in things indifferentsometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of themshall dispossess a third of his dominions where neither of them pretendto any right  sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear theother should quarrel with him  sometimes a war is entered upon becausethe enemy is too strong and sometimes because he is too weaksometimes our neighbours want the things which we have or have thethings which we want and we both fight till they take ours or give ustheirs  it is a very justifiable cause of a war to invade a countryafter the people have been wasted by famine destroyed by pestilence orembroiled by factions among themselves  it is justifiable to enter intowar against our nearest ally when one of his towns lies convenient forus or a territory of land that would render our dominions round andcomplete  if a prince sends forces into a nation where the people arepoor and ignorant he may lawfully put half of them to death and makeslaves of the rest in order to civilize and reduce them from theirbarbarous way of living  it is a very kingly honourable and frequentpractice when one prince desires the assistance of another to securehim against an invasion that the assistant when he has driven out theinvader should seize on the dominions himself and kill imprison orbanish the prince he came to relieve  alliance by blood or marriageis a frequent cause of war between princes and the nearer the kindredis the greater their disposition to quarrel poor nations are hungryand rich nations are proud and pride and hunger will ever be atvariance  for these reasons the trade of a soldier is held the mosthonourable of all others because a soldier is a yahoo hired to killin cold blood as many of his own species who have never offended himas possibly he canthere is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in europe not able to makewar by themselves who hire out their troops to richer nations for somuch a day to each man of which they keep threefourths to themselvesand it is the best part of their maintenance such are those in manynorthern parts of europewhat you have told me said my master upon the subject of war doesindeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend tohowever it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger and thatnature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief  for yourmouths lying flat with your faces you can hardly bite each other to anypurpose unless by consent  then as to the claws upon your feet beforeand behind they are so short and tender that one of our yahoos woulddrive a dozen of yours before him  and therefore in recounting thenumbers of those who have been killed in battle i cannot but think youhave said the thing which is noti could not forbear shaking my head and smiling a little at hisignorance  and being no stranger to the art of war i gave him adescription of cannons culverins muskets carabines pistols bulletspowder swords bayonets battles sieges retreats attacks underminescountermines bombardments sea fights ships sunk with a thousand mentwenty thousand killed on each side dying groans limbs flying in theair smoke noise confusion trampling to death under horses feetflight pursuit victory fields strewed with carcases left for food todogs and wolves and birds of prey plundering stripping ravishingburning and destroying  and to set forth the valour of my own dearcountrymen i assured him that i had seen them blow up a hundredenemies at once in a siege and as many in a ship and beheld the deadbodies drop down in pieces from the clouds to the great diversion of thespectatorsi was going on to more particulars when my master commanded me silencehe said whoever understood the nature of yahoos might easily believeit possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action i hadnamed if their strength and cunning equalled their malice  but as mydiscourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species so he foundit gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a strangerbefore  he thought his ears being used to such abominable words mightby degrees admit them with less detestation that although he hated theyahoos of this country yet he no more blamed them for their odiousqualities than he did a gnnayh a bird of prey for its cruelty or asharp stone for cutting his hoof  but when a creature pretending toreason could be capable of such enormities he dreaded lest thecorruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself  heseemed therefore confident that instead of reason we were onlypossessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices as thereflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapenbody not only larger but more distortedhe added that he had heard too much upon the subject of war both inthis and some former discourses  there was another point which a littleperplexed him at present  i had informed him that some of our crew lefttheir country on account of being ruined by law that i had alreadyexplained the meaning of the word but he was at a loss how it shouldcome to pass that the law which was intended for every manspreservation should be any mans ruin  therefore he desired to befurther satisfied what i meant by law and the dispensers thereofaccording to the present practice in my own country because he thoughtnature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal as wepretended to be in showing us what he ought to do and what to avoidi assured his honour that the law was a science in which i had not muchconversed further than by employing advocates in vain upon someinjustices that had been done me however i would give him all thesatisfaction i was ablei said there was a society of men among us bred up from their youth inthe art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose that white isblack and black is white according as they are paid  to this societyall the rest of the people are slaves  for example if my neighbour hasa mind to my cow he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cowfrom me  i must then hire another to defend my right it being againstall rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himselfnow in this case i who am the right owner lie under two greatdisadvantages first my lawyer being practised almost from his cradlein defending falsehood is quite out of his element when he would be anadvocate for justice which is an unnatural office he always attemptswith great awkwardness if not with illwill  the second disadvantageis that my lawyer must proceed with great caution or else he will bereprimanded by the judges and abhorred by his brethren as one thatwould lessen the practice of the law  and therefore i have but twomethods to preserve my cow  the first is to gain over my adversaryslawyer with a double fee who will then betray his client by insinuatingthat he hath justice on his side  the second way is for my lawyer tomake my cause appear as unjust as he can by allowing the cow to belongto my adversary and this if it be skilfully done will certainlybespeak the favour of the bench  now your honour is to know that thesejudges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property aswell as for the trial of criminals and picked out from the mostdexterous lawyers who are grown old or lazy and having been biassed alltheir lives against truth and equity lie under such a fatal necessity offavouring fraud perjury and oppression that i have known some of themrefuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay rather than injurethe faculty by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their officeit is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done beforemay legally be done again and therefore they take special care to recordall the decisions formerly made against common justice and the generalreason of mankind  these under the name of precedents they produce asauthorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions and the judges neverfail of directing accordinglyin pleading they studiously avoid entering into the merits of thecause but are loud violent and tedious in dwelling upon allcircumstances which are not to the purpose  for instance in the casealready mentioned they never desire to know what claim or title myadversary has to my cow but whether the said cow were red or black herhorns long or short whether the field i graze her in be round or squarewhether she was milked at home or abroad what diseases she is subjectto and the like after which they consult precedents adjourn the causefrom time to time and in ten twenty or thirty years come to an issueit is likewise to be observed that this society has a peculiar cant andjargon of their own that no other mortal can understand and wherein alltheir laws are written which they take special care to multiply wherebythey have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood ofright and wrong so that it will take thirty years to decide whether thefield left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to astranger three hundred miles offin the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state the methodis much more short and commendable the judge first sends to sound thedisposition of those in power after which he can easily hang or save acriminal strictly preserving all due forms of lawhere my master interposing said it was a pity that creatures endowedwith such prodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers by thedescription i gave of them must certainly be were not rather encouragedto be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge  in answer to whichi assured his honour that in all points out of their own trade theywere usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us the mostdespicable in common conversation avowed enemies to all knowledge andlearning and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankindin every other subject of discourse as in that of their own professionchapter via continuation of the state of england under queen anne  the characterof a first minister of state in european courtsmy master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives couldincite this race of lawyers to perplex disquiet and weary themselvesand engage in a confederacy of injustice merely for the sake of injuringtheir fellowanimals neither could he comprehend what i meant in sayingthey did it for hire  whereupon i was at much pains to describe to himthe use of money the materials it was made of and the value of themetals that when a yahoo had got a great store of this precioussubstance he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to the finestclothing the noblest houses great tracts of land the most costly meatsand drinks and have his choice of the most beautiful females  thereforesince money alone was able to perform all these feats our yahoosthought they could never have enough of it to spend or to save as theyfound themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion oravarice that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor mans labourand the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former thatthe bulk of our people were forced to live miserably by labouring everyday for small wages to make a few live plentifullyi enlarged myself much on these and many other particulars to the samepurpose but his honour was still to seek for he went upon asupposition that all animals had a title to their share in theproductions of the earth and especially those who presided over therest  therefore he desired i would let him know what these costlymeats were and how any of us happened to want them  whereupon ienumerated as many sorts as came into my head with the various methodsof dressing them which could not be done without sending vessels by seato every part of the world as well for liquors to drink as for saucesand innumerable other conveniences  i assured him that this whole globeof earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our betterfemale yahoos could get her breakfast or a cup to put it in  he saidthat must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for itsown inhabitants  but what he chiefly wondered at was how such vasttracts of ground as i described should be wholly without fresh water andthe people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink  ireplied that england the dear place of my nativity was computed toproduce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants areable to consume as well as liquors extracted from grain or pressed outof the fruit of certain trees which made excellent drink and the sameproportion in every other convenience of life  but in order to feed theluxury and intemperance of the males and the vanity of the females wesent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countrieswhence in return we brought the materials of diseases folly and viceto spend among ourselves  hence it follows of necessity that vastnumbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by beggingrobbing stealing cheating pimping flattering suborning forswearingforging gaming lying fawning hectoring voting scribblingstargazing poisoning whoring canting libelling freethinking andthe like occupations every one of which terms i was at much pains tomake him understandthat wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply thewant of water or other drinks but because it was a sort of liquid whichmade us merry by putting us out of our senses diverted all melancholythoughts begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain raised ourhopes and banished our fears suspended every office of reason for atime and deprived us of the use of our limbs till we fell into aprofound sleep although it must be confessed that we always awaked sickand dispirited and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseaseswhich made our lives uncomfortable and shortbut beside all this the bulk of our people supported themselves byfurnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and toeach other  for instance when i am at home and dressed as i ought tobe i carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen thebuilding and furniture of my house employ as many more and five timesthe number to adorn my wifei was going on to tell him of another sort of people who get theirlivelihood by attending the sick having upon some occasions informedhis honour that many of my crew had died of diseases  but here it waswith the utmost difficulty that i brought him to apprehend what i meanthe could easily conceive that a houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy a fewdays before his death or by some accident might hurt a limb but thatnature who works all things to perfection should suffer any pains tobreed in our bodies he thought impossible and desired to know thereason of so unaccountable an evili told him we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to eachother that we ate when we were not hungry and drank without theprovocation of thirst that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquorswithout eating a bit which disposed us to sloth inflamed our bodiesand precipitated or prevented digestion that prostitute female yahoosacquired a certain malady which bred rottenness in the bones of thosewho fell into their embraces that this and many other diseases werepropagated from father to son so that great numbers came into the worldwith complicated maladies upon them that it would be endless to give hima catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies for they would notbe fewer than five or six hundred spread over every limb and jointinshort every part external and intestine having diseases appropriatedto itself  to remedy which there was a sort of people bred up among usin the profession or pretence of curing the sick  and because i hadsome skill in the faculty i would in gratitude to his honour let himknow the whole mystery and method by which they proceedtheir fundamental is that all diseases arise from repletion whencethey conclude that a great evacuation of the body is necessary eitherthrough the natural passage or upwards at the mouth  their next businessis from herbs minerals gums oils shells salts juices seaweedexcrements barks of trees serpents toads frogs spiders dead mensflesh and bones birds beasts and fishes to form a composition forsmell and taste the most abominable nauseous and detestable they canpossibly contrive which the stomach immediately rejects with loathingand this they call a vomit or else from the same storehouse with someother poisonous additions they command us to take in at the orificeabove or below just as the physician then happens to be disposed amedicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels which relaxingthe belly drives down all before it and this they call a purge or aclyster  for nature as the physicians allege having intended thesuperior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids andliquids and the inferior posterior for ejection these artistsingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of herseat therefore to replace her in it the body must be treated in amanner directly contrary by interchanging the use of each orificeforcing solids and liquids in at the anus and making evacuations at themouthbut besides real diseases we are subject to many that are onlyimaginary for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures thesehave their several names and so have the drugs that are proper for themand with these our female yahoos are always infestedone great excellency in this tribe is their skill at prognosticswherein they seldom fail their predictions in real diseases when theyrise to any degree of malignity generally portending death which isalways in their power when recovery is not and therefore upon anyunexpected signs of amendment after they have

whichevery wise man retires and gives over all hopesthere are three methods by which a man may rise to be chief ministerthe first is by knowing how with prudence to dispose of a wife adaughter or a

having heard me mention the nobility ofmy country was pleased to make me a compliment which i could not pretendto deserve that he was sure i must have been born of some noble familybecause i far exceeded in shape colour and cleanliness all theyahoos of his nation although i seemed to fail in strength andagility which must be imputed to my different way of living from thoseother brutes and besides i was not only endowed with the faculty ofspeech but likewise with some rudiments of reason to a degree thatwith all his acquaintance i passed for a prodigyhe made me observe that among the houyhnhnms the white the sorreland the irongray were not so exactly shaped as the bay thedapplegray and the black nor born with equal talents of mind or acapacity to improve them and therefore continued always in the conditionof servants without ever aspiring to match out of their own race whichin that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnaturali made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion hewas pleased to conceive of me but assured him at the same time that mybirth was of the lower sort having been born of plain honest parentswho were just able to give me a tolerable education that nobility amongus was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it that ouryoung noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxurythat as soon as years will permit they consume their vigour andcontract odious diseases among lewd females and when their fortunes arealmost ruined they marry some woman of mean birth disagreeable personand unsound constitution merely for the sake of money whom they hateand despise  that the productions of such marriages are generallyscrofulous rickety or deformed children by which means the familyseldom continues above three generations unless the wife takes care toprovide a healthy father among her neighbours or domestics in order toimprove and continue the breed  that a weak diseased body a

observationsupon the constitution and administration of england as described by theauthor with parallel cases and comparisons  his masters observationsupon human naturethe reader may be disposed to wonder how i could prevail on myself togive so free a representation of my own species among a race of mortalswho are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind fromthat entire congruity between me and their yahoos  but i must freelyconfess that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds placed inopposite view to human corruptions had so far opened my eyes andenlarged my understanding that i began to view the actions and passionsof man in a very different light and to think the honour of my own kindnot worth managing which besides it was impossible for me to dobefore a person of so acute a judgment as my master who daily convincedme of a thousand faults in myself whereof i had not the least perceptionbefore and which with us would never be numbered even among humaninfirmities  i had likewise learned from his example an utterdetestation of all falsehood or disguise and truth appeared so amiableto me that i determined upon sacrificing every thing to itlet me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yeta much stronger motive for the freedom i took in my representation ofthings  i had not yet been a year in this country before i contractedsuch a love and veneration for the inhabitants that i entered on a firmresolution never to return to humankind but to pass the rest of my lifeamong these admirable houyhnhnms in the contemplation and practice ofevery virtue where i could have no example or incitement to vice  butit was decreed by fortune my perpetual enemy that so great a felicityshould not fall to my share  however it is now some comfort to reflectthat in what i said of my countrymen i extenuated their faults as muchas i durst before so strict an examiner and upon every article gave asfavourable a turn as the matter would bear  for indeed who is therealive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place ofhis birthi have related the substance of several conversations i had with mymaster during the greatest part of the time i had the honour to be in hisservice but have indeed for brevity sake omitted much more than ishere set downwhen i had answered all his questions and his curiosity seemed to befully satisfied he sent for me one morning early and commanded me tosit down at some distance an honour which he had never before conferredupon me  he said he had been very seriously considering my wholestory as far as it related both to myself and my country that he lookedupon us as a sort of animals to whose share by what accident he couldnot conjecture some small pittance of reason had fallen whereof we madeno other use than by its assistance to aggravate our naturalcorruptions and to acquire new ones which nature had not given us thatwe disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed had beenvery successful in multiplying our original wants and seemed to spendour whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventionsthat as to myself it was manifest i had neither the strength noragility of a common yahoo that i walked infirmly on my hinder feethad found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence and toremove the hair from my chin which was intended as a shelter from thesun and the weather lastly that i could neither run with speed norclimb trees like my brethren as he called them the yahoos in hiscountrythat our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to ourgross defects in reason and by consequence in virtue because reasonalone is sufficient to govern a rational creature which was thereforea character we had no pretence to challenge even from the account i hadgiven of my own people although he manifestly perceived that in orderto favour them i had concealed many particulars and often said thething which was nothe was the more confirmed in this opinion because he observed that asi agreed in every feature of my body with other yahoos except where itwas to my real disadvantage in point of strength speed and activitythe shortness of my claws and some other particulars where nature had nopart so from the representation i had given him of our lives ourmanners and our actions he found as near a resemblance in thedisposition of our minds  he said the yahoos were known to hate oneanother more than they did any different species of animals and thereason usually assigned was the odiousness of their own shapes whichall could see in the rest but not in themselves  he had therefore begunto think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies and by that inventionconceal many of our deformities from each other which would else behardly supportable  but he now found he had been mistaken and that thedissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same causewith ours as i had described them  for if said he you throw amongfive yahoos as much food as would be sufficient for fifty they willinstead of eating peaceably fall together by the ears each single oneimpatient to have all to itself and therefore a servant was usuallyemployed to stand by while they were feeding abroad and those kept athome were tied at a distance from each other that if a cow died of ageor accident before a houyhnhnm could secure it for his own yahoosthose in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it and thenwould ensue such a battle as i had described with terrible wounds madeby their claws on both sides although they seldom were able to kill oneanother for want of such convenient instruments of death as we hadinvented  at other times the like battles have been fought between theyahoos of several neighbourhoods without any visible cause those ofone district watching all opportunities to surprise the next before theyare prepared  but if they find their project has miscarried they returnhome and for want of enemies engage in what i call a civil war amongthemselvesthat in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones ofseveral colours whereof the yahoos are violently fond and when partof these stones is fixed in the earth as it sometimes happens they willdig with their claws for whole days to get them out then carry themaway and hide them by heaps in their kennels but still looking roundwith great caution for fear their comrades should find out theirtreasure  my master said he could never discover the reason of thisunnatural appetite or how these stones could be of any use to a yahoobut now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avaricewhich i had ascribed to mankind  that he had once by way of experimentprivately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of hisyahoos had buried it whereupon the sordid animal missing histreasure by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the placethere miserably howled then fell to biting and tearing the rest beganto pine away would neither eat nor sleep nor work till he ordered aservant privately to convey the stones into the same hole and hide themas before which when his yahoo had found he presently recovered hisspirits and good humour but took good care to remove them to a betterhiding place and has ever since been a very serviceable brutemy master further assured me which i also observed myself that in thefields where the shining stones abound the fiercest and most frequentbattles are fought occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouringyahooshe said it was common when two yahoos discovered such a stone in afield and were contending which of them should be the proprietor athird would take the advantage and carry it away from them both whichmy master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with oursuits at law wherein i thought it for our credit not to undeceive himsince the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decreesamong us because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing besidethe stone they contended for whereas our courts of equity would neverhave dismissed the cause while either of them had any thing leftmy master continuing his discourse said there was nothing thatrendered the yahoos more odious than their undistinguishing appetiteto devour every thing that came in their way whether herbs rootsberries the corrupted flesh of animals or all mingled together and itwas peculiar in their temper that they were fonder of what they couldget by rapine or stealth at a greater distance than much better foodprovided for them at home  if their prey held out they would eat tillthey were ready to burst after which nature had pointed out to them acertain root that gave them a general evacuationthere was also another kind of root very juicy but somewhat rare anddifficult to be found which the yahoos sought for with much eagernessand would suck it with great delight it produced in them the sameeffects that wine has upon us  it would make them sometimes hug andsometimes tear one another they would howl and grin and chatter andreel and tumble and then fall asleep in the mudi did indeed observe that the yahoos were the only animals in thiscountry subject to any diseases which however were much fewer thanhorses have among us and contracted not by any illtreatment they meetwith but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute  neitherhas their language any more than a general appellation for thosemaladies which is borrowed from the name of the beast and calledhneayahoo or yahoos evil and the cure prescribed is a mixture oftheir own dung and urine forcibly put down the yahoos throat  this ihave since often known to have been taken with success and do herefreely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good as an admirablespecific against all diseases produced by repletionas to learning government arts manufactures and the like my masterconfessed he could find little or no resemblance between the yahoosof that country and those in ours for he only meant to observe whatparity there was in our natures  he had heard indeed some curioushouyhnhnms observe that in most herds there was a sort of rulingyahoo as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag ina park who was always more deformed in body and mischievous indisposition than any of the rest that this leader had usually afavourite as like himself as he could get whose employment was to lickhis masters feet and posteriors and drive the female yahoos to hiskennel for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of asssflesh  this favourite is hated by the whole herd and therefore toprotect himself keeps always near the person of his leader  he usuallycontinues in office till a worse can be found but the very moment he isdiscarded his successor at the head of all the yahoos in thatdistrict young and old male and female come in a body and dischargetheir excrements upon him from head to foot  but how far this might beapplicable to our courts and favourites and ministers of state mymaster said i could best determinei durst make no return to this malicious insinuation which debased humanunderstanding below the sagacity of a common hound who has judgmentenough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the packwithout being ever mistakenmy master told me there were some qualities remarkable in the yahooswhich he had not observed me to mention or at least very slightly inthe accounts i had given of humankind  he said those animals likeother brutes had their females in common but in this they differedthat the she yahoo would admit the males while she was pregnant andthat the hes would quarrel and fight with the females as fiercely aswith each other both which practices were such degrees of infamousbrutality as no other sensitive creature ever arrived atanother thing he wondered at in the yahoos was their strangedisposition to nastiness and dirt whereas there appears to be a naturallove of cleanliness in all other animals  as to the two formeraccusations i was glad to let them pass without any reply because i hadnot a word to offer upon them in defence of my species which otherwise icertainly had done from my own inclinations  but i could have easilyvindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the lastarticle if there had been any swine in that country as unluckily for methere were not which although it may be a sweeter quadruped than ayahoo cannot i humbly conceive in justice pretend to morecleanliness and so his honour himself must have owned if he had seentheir filthy way of feeding and their custom of wallowing and sleepingin the mudmy master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants haddiscovered in several yahoos and to him was wholly unaccountable  hesaid a fancy would sometimes take a yahoo to retire into a corner tolie down and howl and groan and spurn away all that came near himalthough he were young and fat wanted neither food nor water nor didthe servant imagine what could possibly ail him  and the only remedythey found was to set him to hard work after which he would infalliblycome to himself  to this i was silent out of partiality to my own kindyet here i could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen which onlyseizes on the lazy the luxurious and the rich who if they were forcedto undergo the same regimen i would undertake for the curehis honour had further observed that a female yahoo would often standbehind a bank or a bush to gaze on the young males passing by and thenappear and hide using many antic gestures and grimaces at which timeit was observed that she had a most offensive smell and when any of themales advanced would slowly retire looking often back and with acounterfeit show of fear run off into some convenient place where sheknew the male would follow herat other times if a female stranger came among them three or four ofher own sex would get about her and stare and chatter and grin andsmell her all over and then turn off with gestures that seemed toexpress contempt and disdainperhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations which hehad drawn from what he observed himself or had been told him by othershowever i could not reflect without some amazement and much sorrowthat the rudiments of lewdness coquetry censure and scandal shouldhave place by instinct in womankindi expected every moment that my master would accuse the yahoos of thoseunnatural appetites in both sexes so common among us  but nature itseems has not been so expert a schoolmistress and these politerpleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side ofthe globechapter viiithe author relates several particulars of the yahoos  the greatvirtues of the houyhnhnms  the education and exercise of their youththeir general assemblyas i ought to have understood human nature much better than i supposed itpossible for my master to do so it was easy to apply the character hegave of the yahoos to myself and my countrymen and i believed i couldyet make further discoveries from my own observation  i therefore oftenbegged his honour to let me go among the herds of yahoos in theneighbourhood to which he always very graciously consented beingperfectly convinced that the hatred i bore these brutes would neversuffer me to be corrupted by them and his honour ordered one of hisservants a strong sorrel nag very honest and goodnatured to be myguard without whose protection i durst not undertake such adventuresfor i have already told the reader how much i was pestered by theseodious animals upon my first arrival and i afterwards failed verynarrowly three or four times of falling into their clutches when ihappened to stray at any distance without my hanger  and i have reasonto believe they had some imagination that i was of their own specieswhich i often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves and showing mynaked arms and breasts in their sight when my protector was with me  atwhich times they would approach as near as they durst and imitate myactions after the manner of monkeys but ever with great signs of hatredas a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wildones when he happens to be got among themthey are prodigiously nimble from their infancy  however i once caughta young male of three years old and endeavoured by all marks oftenderness to make it quiet but the little imp fell a squalling andscratching and biting with such violence that i was forced to let itgo and it was high time for a whole troop of old ones came about us atthe noise but finding the cub was safe for away it ran and my sorrelnag being by they durst not venture near us  i observed the younganimals flesh to smell very rank and the stink was somewhat between aweasel and a fox but much more disagreeable  i forgot anothercircumstance and perhaps i might have the readers pardon if it werewholly omitted that while i held the odious vermin in my hands itvoided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over myclothes but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by where iwashed myself as clean as i could although i durst not come into mymasters presence until i were sufficiently airedby what i could discover the yahoos appear to be the most unteachableof all animals their capacity never reaching higher than to draw orcarry burdens  yet i am of opinion this defect arises chiefly from aperverse restive disposition for they are cunning malicioustreacherous and revengeful  they are strong and hardy but of acowardly spirit and by consequence insolent abject and cruel  it isobserved that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous andmischievous than the rest whom yet they much exceed in strength andactivitythe houyhnhnms keep the yahoos for present use in huts not far fromthe house but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields where they digup roots eat several kinds of herbs and search about for carrion orsometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs a sort of wild rat which theygreedily devour  nature has taught them to dig deep holes with theirnails on the side of a rising ground wherein they lie by themselvesonly the kennels of the females are larger sufficient to hold two orthree cubsthey swim from their infancy like frogs and are able to continue longunder water where they often take fish which the females carry home totheir young  and upon this occasion i hope the reader will pardon myrelating an odd adventurebeing one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag and the weatherexceeding hot i entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was nearhe consented and i immediately stripped myself stark naked and wentdown softly into the stream  it happened that a young female yahoostanding behind a bank saw the whole proceeding and inflamed by desireas the nag and i conjectured came running with all speed and leapedinto the water within five yards of the place where i bathed  i wasnever in my life so terribly frightened  the nag was grazing at somedistance not suspecting any harm  she embraced me after a most fulsomemanner  i roared as loud as i could and the nag came galloping towardsme whereupon she quitted her grasp with the utmost reluctancy andleaped upon the opposite bank where she stood gazing and howling all thetime i was putting on my clothesthis was a matter of diversion to my master and his family as well as ofmortification to myself  for now i could no longer deny that i was areal yahoo in every limb and feature since the females had a naturalpropensity to me as one of their own species  neither was the hair ofthis brute of a red colour which might have been some excuse for anappetite a little irregular but black as a sloe and her countenancedid not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kindfor i think she could not be above eleven years oldhaving lived three years in this country the reader i suppose willexpect that i should like other travellers give him some account of themanners and customs of its inhabitants which it was indeed my principalstudy to learnas these noble houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with a generaldisposition to all virtues and have no conceptions or ideas of what isevil in a rational creature so their grand maxim is to cultivatereason and to be wholly governed by it  neither is reason among them apoint problematical as with us where men can argue with plausibility onboth sides of the question but strikes you with immediate conviction asit must needs do where it is not mingled obscured or discoloured bypassion and interest  i remember it was with extreme difficulty that icould bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion orhow a point could be disputable because reason taught us to affirm ordeny only where we are certain and beyond our knowledge we cannot doeither  so that controversies wranglings disputes and positivenessin false or dubious propositions are evils unknown among thehouyhnhnms  in the like manner when i used to explain to him ourseveral systems of natural philosophy he would laugh that a creaturepretending to reason should value itself upon the knowledge of otherpeoples conjectures and in things where that knowledge if it werecertain could be of no use  wherein he agreed entirely with thesentiments of socrates as plato delivers them which i mention as thehighest honour i can do that prince of philosophers  i have often sincereflected what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries ofeurope and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learnedworldfriendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among thehouyhnhnms and these not confined to particular objects but universalto the whole race for a stranger from the remotest part is equallytreated with the nearest neighbour and wherever he goes looks uponhimself as at home  they preserve decency and civility in the highestdegrees but are altogether ignorant of ceremony  they have no fondnessfor their colts or foals but the care they take in educating themproceeds entirely from the dictates of reason  and i observed my masterto show the same affection to his neighbours issue that he had for hisown  they will have it that nature teaches them to love the wholespecies and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons wherethere is a superior degree of virtuewhen the matron houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex they nolonger accompany with their consorts except they lose one of their issueby some casualty which very seldom happens but in such a case they meetagain or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is pastbearing some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts and thengo together again until the mother is pregnant  this caution isnecessary to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbersbut the race of inferior houyhnhnms bred up to be servants is not sostrictly limited upon this article these are allowed to produce three ofeach sex to be domestics in the noble familiesin their marriages they are exactly careful to choose such colours aswill not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed  strength is chieflyvalued in the male and comeliness in the female not upon the account oflove but to preserve the race from degenerating for where a femalehappens to excel in strength a consort is chosen with regard tocomelinesscourtship love presents jointures settlements have no place in theirthoughts or terms whereby to express them in their language  the youngcouple meet and are joined merely because it is the determination oftheir parents and friends it is what they see done every day and theylook upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being  butthe violation of marriage or any other unchastity was never heard ofand the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutualbenevolence that they bear to all others of the same species who come intheir way without jealousy fondness quarrelling or discontentin educating the youth of both sexes their method is admirable andhighly deserves our imitation  these are not suffered to taste a grainof oats except upon certain days till eighteen years old nor milk butvery rarely and in summer they graze two hours in the morning and asmany in the evening which their parents likewise observe but theservants are not allowed above half that time and a great part of theirgrass is brought home which they eat at the most convenient hours whenthey can be best spared from worktemperance industry exercise and cleanliness are the lessons equallyenjoined to the young ones of both sexes and my master thought itmonstrous in us to give the females a different kind of education fromthe males except in some articles of domestic management whereby as hetruly observed one half of our natives were good for nothing butbringing children into the world and to trust the care of our childrento such useless animals he said was yet a greater instance ofbrutalitybut the houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength speed andhardiness by exercising them in running races up and down steep hillsand over hard stony grounds and when they are all in a sweat they areordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river  four times ayear the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency inrunning and leaping and other feats of strength and agility where thevictor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise  on this festivalthe servants drive a herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay andoats and milk for a repast to the houyhnhnms after which thesebrutes are immediately driven back again for fear of being noisome tothe assemblyevery fourth year at the vernal equinox there is a representativecouncil of the whole nation which meets in a plain about twenty milesfrom our house and continues about five or six days  here they inquireinto the state and condition of the several districts whether theyabound or be deficient in hay or oats or cows or yahoos and whereverthere is any want which is but seldom it is immediately supplied byunanimous consent and contribution  here likewise the regulation ofchildren is settled as for instance if a houyhnhnm has two males hechanges one of them with another that has two females and when a childhas been lost by any casualty where the mother is past breeding it isdetermined what family in the district shall breed another to supply thelosschapter ixa grand debate at the general assembly of the houyhnhnms and how itwas determined  the learning of the houyhnhnms  their buildingstheir manner of burials  the defectiveness of their languageone of these grand assemblies was held in my time about three monthsbefore my departure whither my master went as the representative of ourdistrict  in this council was resumed their old debate and indeed theonly debate that ever happened in their country whereof my master afterhis return give me a very particular accountthe question to be debated was whether the yahoos should beexterminated from the face of the earth  one of the members for theaffirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weightalleging that as the yahoos were the most filthy noisome anddeformed animals which nature ever produced so they were the mostrestive and indocible mischievous and malicious they would privatelysuck the teats of the houyhnhnms cows kill and devour their catstrample down their oats and grass if they were not continually watchedand commit a thousand other extravagancies  he took notice of a generaltradition that yahoos had not been always in their country but thatmany ages ago two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountainwhether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime orfrom the ooze and froth of the sea was never known that these yahoosengendered and their brood in a short time grew so numerous as tooverrun and infest the whole nation that the houyhnhnms to get rid ofthis evil made a general hunting and at last enclosed the whole herdand destroying the elder every houyhnhnm kept two young ones in akennel and brought them to such a degree of tameness as an animal sosavage by nature can be capable of acquiring using them for draught andcarriage that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition and thatthose creatures could not be yinhniamshy or aborigines of the landbecause of the violent hatred the houyhnhnms as well as all otheranimals bore them which although their evil disposition sufficientlydeserved could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had beenaborigines or else they would have long since been rooted out thatthe inhabitants taking a fancy to use the service of the yahoos hadvery imprudently neglected to cultivate the breed of asses which are acomely animal easily kept more tame and orderly without any offensivesmell strong enough for labour although they yield to the other inagility of body and if their braying be no agreeable sound it is farpreferable to the horrible howlings of the yahoosseveral others declared their sentiments to the same purpose when mymaster proposed an expedient to the assembly whereof he had indeedborrowed the hint from me  he approved of the tradition mentioned bythe honourable member who spoke before and affirmed that the twoyahoos said to be seen first among them had been driven thither overthe sea that coming to land and being forsaken by their companionsthey retired to the mountains and degenerating by degrees became inprocess of time much more savage than those of their own species in thecountry whence these two originals came  the reason of this assertionwas that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful yahoomeaning myself which most of them had heard of and many of them hadseen  he then related to them how he first found me that my body wasall covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of otheranimals that i spoke in a language of my own and had thoroughly learnedtheirs that i had related to him the accidents which brought me thitherthat when he saw me without my covering i was an exact yahoo in everypart only of a whiter colour less hairy and with shorter claws  headded how i had endeavoured to persuade him that in my own and othercountries the yahoos acted as the governing rational animal and heldthe houyhnhnms in servitude that he observed in me all the qualitiesof a yahoo only a little more civilized by some tincture of reasonwhich however was in a degree as far inferior to the houyhnhnm raceas the yahoos of their country were to me that among other things imentioned a custom we had of castrating houyhnhnms when they wereyoung in order to render them tame that the operation was easy andsafe that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes as industry istaught by the ant and building by the swallow for so i translate theword lyhannh although it be a much larger fowl that this inventionmight be practised upon the younger yahoos here which besidesrendering them tractable and fitter for use would in an age put an endto the whole species without destroying life that in the mean time thehouyhnhnms should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses whichas they are in all respects more valuable brutes so they have thisadvantage to be fit for service at five years old which the others arenot till twelvethis was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of whatpassed in the grand council  but he was pleased to conceal oneparticular which related personally to myself whereof i soon felt theunhappy effect as the reader will know in its proper place and whence idate all the succeeding misfortunes of my lifethe houyhnhnms have no letters and consequently their knowledge is alltraditional  but there happening few events of any moment among a peopleso well united naturally disposed to every virtue wholly governed byreason and cut off from all commerce with other nations the historicalpart is easily preserved without burdening their memories  i havealready observed that they are subject to no diseases and therefore canhave no need of physicians  however they have excellent medicinescomposed of herbs to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern orfrog of the foot by sharp stones as well as other maims and hurts inthe several parts of the bodythey calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon but use nosubdivisions into weeks  they are well enough acquainted with themotions of those two luminaries and understand the nature of eclipsesand this is the utmost progress of their astronomyin poetry they must be allowed to excel all other mortals wherein thejustness of their similes and the minuteness as well as exactness oftheir descriptions are indeed inimitable  their verses abound very muchin both of these and usually contain either some exalted notions offriendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors inraces and other bodily exercises  their buildings although very rudeand simple are not inconvenient but well contrived to defend them fromall injuries of cold and heat  they have a kind of tree which at fortyyears old loosens in the root and falls with the first storm it growsvery straight and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone for thehouyhnhnms know not the use of iron they stick them erect in theground about ten inches asunder and then weave in oat straw orsometimes wattles between them  the roof is made after the same mannerand so are the doorsthe houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the hoof oftheir forefoot as we do our hands and this with greater dexterity thani could at first imagine  i have seen a white mare of our family threada needle which i lent her on purpose with that joint  they milk theircows reap their oats and do all the work which requires hands in thesame manner  they have a kind of hard flints which by grinding againstother stones they form into instruments that serve instead of wedgesaxes and hammers  with tools made of these flints they likewise cuttheir hay and reap their oats which there grow naturally in severalfields the yahoos draw home the sheaves in carriages and the servantstread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain which is kept instores  they make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels and bakethe former in the sunif they can avoid casualties they die only of old age and are buried inthe obscurest places that can be found their friends and relationsexpressing neither joy nor grief at their departure nor does the dyingperson discover the least regret that he is leaving the world any morethan if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of hisneighbours  i remember my master having once made an appointment with afriend and his family to come to his house upon some affair ofimportance on the day fixed the mistress and her two children came verylate she made two excuses first for her husband who as she saidhappened that very morning to shnuwnh  the word is strongly expressivein their language but not easily rendered into english it signifiesto retire to his first mother  her excuse for not coming sooner wasthat her husband dying late in the morning she was a good whileconsulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should belaid and i observed she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully asthe rest  she died about three months afterthey live generally to seventy or seventyfive years very seldom tofourscore  some weeks before their death they feel a gradual decay butwithout pain  during this time they are much visited by their friendsbecause they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfactionhowever about ten days before their death which they seldom fail incomputing they return the visits that have been made them by those whoare nearest in the neighbourhood being carried in a convenient sledgedrawn by yahoos which vehicle they use not only upon this occasionbut when they grow old upon long journeys or when they are lamed by anyaccident and therefore when the dying houyhnhnms return those visitsthey take a solemn leave of their friends as if they were going to someremote part of the country where they designed to pass the rest of theirlivesi know not whether it may be worth observing that the houyhnhnms haveno word in their language to express any thing that is evil except whatthey borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the yahoos  thusthey denote the folly of a servant an omission of a child a stone thatcuts their feet a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather and thelike by adding to each the epithet of yahoo  for instance hhnmyahoo whnaholm yahoo ynlhmndwihlma yahoo and an

about six yardsfrom the house the sides and floors of which i plastered with clay andcovered with rushmats of my own contriving  i had beaten hemp whichthere grows wild and made of it a sort of ticking this i filled withthe feathers of several birds i had taken with springes made of yahooshairs and were excellent food  i had worked two chairs with my knifethe sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part  whenmy clothes were worn to rags i made myself others with the skins ofrabbits and of a certain beautiful animal about the same size callednnuhnoh the skin of which is covered with a fine down  of these ialso made very tolerable stockings  i soled my shoes with wood which icut from a tree and fitted to the upperleather and when this was wornout i supplied it with

tovisit or dine with my master where his honour graciously suffered me towait in the room and listen to their discourse  both he and his companywould often descend to ask me questions and receive my answers  i hadalso sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to othersi never presumed to speak except in answer to a question and then i didit with inward regret because it was a loss of so much time forimproving myself but i was infinitely delighted with the station of anhumble auditor in such conversations where nothing passed but what wasuseful expressed in the fewest and most significant words where as ihave already said the greatest decency was observed without the leastdegree of ceremony where no person spoke without being pleased himselfand pleasing his companions where there was no interruptiontediousness heat or difference of sentiments  they have a notion thatwhen people are met together a short silence does much improveconversation this i found to be true for during those littleintermissions of talk new ideas would arise in their minds which verymuch enlivened the discourse  their subjects are generally onfriendship and benevolence on order and economy sometimes upon thevisible operations of nature or ancient traditions upon the bounds andlimits of virtue upon the unerring rules of reason or upon somedeterminations to be taken at the next great assembly and often upon thevarious excellences of poetry  i may add without vanity that mypresence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse because itafforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history ofme and my country upon which they were all pleased to descant in amanner not very advantageous to humankind and for that reason i shallnot repeat what they said only i may be allowed to observe that hishonour to my great admiration appeared to understand the nature ofyahoos much better than myself  he went through all our vices andfollies and discovered many which i had never mentioned to him by onlysupposing what qualities a yahoo of their country with a smallproportion of reason might be capable of exerting and concluded withtoo much probability how vile as well as miserable such a creaturemust bei freely confess that all the little knowledge i have of any value wasacquired by the lectures i received from my master and from hearing thediscourses of him and his friends to which i should be prouder tolisten than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in europe  iadmired the strength comeliness and speed of the inhabitants and sucha constellation of virtues in such amiable persons produced in me thehighest veneration  at first indeed i did not feel that natural awewhich the yahoos and all other animals bear toward them but it grewupon me by decrees much sooner than i imagined and was mingled with arespectful love and gratitude that they would condescend to distinguishme from the rest of my specieswhen i thought of my family my friends my countrymen or the human racein general i considered them as they really were yahoos in shape anddisposition perhaps a little more civilized and qualified with the giftof speech but making no other use of reason than to improve andmultiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only theshare that nature allotted them  when i happened to behold thereflection of my own form in a lake or fountain i turned away my face inhorror and detestation of myself and could better endure the sight of acommon yahoo than of my own person  by conversing with thehouyhnhnms and looking upon them with delight i fell to imitate theirgait and gesture which is now grown into a habit and my friends oftentell me in a blunt way that i trot like a horse which however itake for a great compliment  neither shall i disown that in speaking iam apt to fall into the voice and manner of the houyhnhnms and hearmyself ridiculed on that account without the least mortificationin the midst of all this happiness and when i looked upon myself to befully settled for life my master sent for me one morning a littleearlier than his usual hour  i observed by his countenance that he wasin some perplexity and at a loss how to begin what he had to speakafter a short silence he told me he did not know how i would take whathe was going to say that in the last general assembly when the affairof the yahoos was entered upon the representatives had taken offenceat his keeping a yahoo meaning myself in his family more like ahouyhnhnm than a brute animal that he was known frequently to conversewith me as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my companythat such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature or a thingever heard of before among them the assembly did therefore exhort himeither to employ me like the rest of my species or command me to swimback to the place whence i came that the first of these expedients wasutterly rejected by all the houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at hishouse or their own for they alleged that because i had some rudimentsof reason added to the natural pravity of those animals it was to befeared i might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainousparts of the country and bring them in troops by night to destroy thehouyhnhnms cattle as being naturally of the ravenous kind and aversefrom labourmy master added that he was daily pressed by the houyhnhnms of theneighbourhood to have the assemblys exhortation executed which he couldnot put off much longer  he doubted it would be impossible for me toswim to another country and therefore wished i would contrive some sortof vehicle resembling those i had described to him that might carry meon the sea in which work i should have the assistance of his ownservants as well as those of his neighbours  he concluded that forhis own part he could have been content to keep me in his service aslong as i lived because he found i had cured myself of some bad habitsand dispositions by endeavouring as far as my inferior nature wascapable to imitate the houyhnhnmsi should here observe to the reader that a decree of the generalassembly in this country is expressed by the word hnhloayn whichsignifies an exhortation as near as i can render it for they have noconception how a rational creature can be compelled but only advised orexhorted because no person can disobey reason without giving up hisclaim to be a rational creaturei was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my masters discourseand being unable to support the agonies i was under i fell into a swoonat his feet  when i came to myself he told me that he concluded i hadbeen dead for these people are subject to no such imbecilities ofnature  i answered in a faint voice that death would have been toogreat a happiness that although i could not blame the assemblysexhortation or the urgency of his friends yet in my weak and corruptjudgment i thought it might consist with reason to have been lessrigorous that i could not swim a league and probably the nearest landto theirs might be distant above a hundred that many materialsnecessary for making a small vessel to carry me off were wholly wantingin this country which however i would attempt in obedience andgratitude to his honour although i concluded the thing to be impossibleand therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction thatthe certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evilsfor supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure howcould i think with temper of passing my days among yahoos andrelapsing into my old corruptions for want of examples to lead and keepme within the paths of virtue that i knew too well upon what solidreasons all the determinations of the wise houyhnhnms were founded notto be shaken by arguments of mine a miserable yahoo and thereforeafter presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servantsassistance in making a vessel and desiring a reasonable time for sodifficult a work i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretchedbeing and if ever i returned to england was not without hopes of beinguseful to my own species by celebrating the praises of the renownedhouyhnhnms and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankindmy master in a few words made me a very gracious reply allowed me thespace of two months to finish my boat and ordered the sorrel nag myfellowservant for so at this distance i may presume to call him tofollow my instruction because i told my master that his help would besufficient and i knew he had a tenderness for mein his company my first business was to go to that part of the coastwhere my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore  i got upon aheight and looking on every side into the sea fancied i saw a smallisland toward the northeast  i took out my pocket glass and could thenclearly distinguish it above five leagues off as i computed but itappeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud for as he had noconception of any country beside his own so he could not be as expert indistinguishing remote objects at sea as we who so much converse in thatelementafter i had discovered this island i considered no further but resolvedit should if possible be the first place of my banishment leaving theconsequence to fortunei returned home and consulting with the sorrel nag we went into a copseat some distance where i with my knife and he with a sharp flintfastened very artificially after their manner to a wooden handle cutdown several oak wattles about the thickness of a walkingstaff andsome larger pieces  but i shall not trouble the reader with a particulardescription of my own mechanics let it suffice to say that in six weekstime with the help of the sorrel nag who performed the parts thatrequired most labour i finished a sort of indian canoe but much largercovering it with the skins of yahoos well stitched together withhempen threads of my own making  my sail was likewise composed of theskins of the same animal but i made use of the youngest i could get theolder being too tough and thick and i likewise provided myself with fourpaddles  i laid in a stock of boiled flesh of rabbits and fowls andtook with me two vessels one filled with milk and the other with wateri tried my canoe in a large pond near my masters house and thencorrected in it what was amiss stopping all the chinks with yahoostallow till i found it staunch and able to bear me and my freight andwhen it was as complete as i could possibly make it i had it drawn on acarriage very gently by yahoos to the seaside under the conduct ofthe sorrel nag and another servantwhen all was ready and the day came for my departure i took leave of mymaster and lady and the whole family my eyes flowing with tears and myheart quite sunk with grief  but his honour out of curiosity andperhaps if i may speak without vanity partly out of kindness wasdetermined to see me in my canoe and got several of his neighbouringfriends to accompany him  i was forced to wait above an hour for thetide and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward theisland to which i intended to steer my course i took a second leave ofmy master but as i was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof hedid me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth  i am not ignorant howmuch i have been censured for mentioning this last particulardetractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious aperson should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to acreature so inferior as i  neither have i forgotten how apt sometravellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have receivedbut if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble andcourteous disposition of the

couldi was at a loss what to do for i durst not return to the samelandingplace but stood to the north and was forced to paddle for thewind though very gentle was against me blowing northwest  as i waslooking about for a secure landingplace i saw a sail to thenorthnortheast which appearing every minute more visible i was insome doubt whether i should wait for them or not but at last mydetestation of the yahoo race prevailed and turning my canoe i sailedand paddled together to the south and got into the same creek whence iset out in the morning choosing rather to trust myself among thesebarbarians than live with european yahoos  i drew up my canoe asclose as i could to the shore and hid myself behind a stone by thelittle brook which as i have already said was excellent waterthe ship came within half a league of this creek and sent her long boatwith vessels to take in fresh water for the place it seems was verywell known but i did not observe it till the boat was almost on shoreand it was too late to seek another hidingplace  the seamen at theirlanding observed my canoe and rummaging it all over easily conjecturedthat the owner could not be far off  four of them well armed searchedevery cranny and lurkinghole till at last they found me flat on my facebehind the stone  they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouthdress my coat made of skins my woodensoled shoes and my furredstockings whence however they concluded i was not a native of theplace who all go naked  one of the seamen in portuguese bid me riseand asked who i was  i understood that language very well and gettingupon my feet said i was a poor yahoo banished from the houyhnhnmsand desired they would please to let me depart  they admired to hear meanswer them in their own tongue and saw by my complexion i must be aeuropean but were at a loss to know what i meant by yahoos andhouyhnhnms and at the same time fell alaughing at my strange tone inspeaking which resembled the neighing of a horse  i trembled all thewhile betwixt fear and hatred  i again desired leave to depart and wasgently moving to my canoe but they laid hold of me desiring to knowwhat country i was of whence i came with many other questions  itold them i was born in england whence i came about five years ago andthen their country and ours were at peace  i therefore hoped they wouldnot treat me as an enemy since i meant them no harm but was a pooryahoo seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of hisunfortunate lifewhen they began to talk i thought i never heard or saw any thing moreunnatural for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow shouldspeak in england or a yahoo in houyhnhnmland  the honest portuguesewere equally amazed at my strange dress and the odd manner of deliveringmy words which however they understood very well  they spoke to mewith great humanity and said they were sure the captain would carry megratis to lisbon whence i might return to my own country that two ofthe seamen would go back to the ship inform the captain of what they hadseen and receive his orders in the mean time unless i would give mysolemn oath not to fly they would secure me by force  i thought it bestto comply with their proposal  they were very curious to know my storybut i gave them very little satisfaction and they all conjectured thatmy misfortunes had impaired my reason  in two hours the boat which wentladen with vessels of water returned with the captains command tofetch me on board  i fell on my knees to preserve my liberty but allwas in vain and the men having tied me with cords heaved me into theboat whence i was taken into the ship and thence into the captainscabinhis name was pedro de mendez he was a very courteous and generousperson  he entreated me to give some account of myself and desired toknow what i would eat or drink said i should be used as well ashimself and spoke so many obliging things that i wondered to find suchcivilities from a yahoo  however i remained silent and sullen i wasready to faint at the very smell of him and his men  at last i desiredsomething to eat out of my own canoe but he ordered me a chicken andsome excellent wine and then directed that i should be put to bed in avery clean cabin  i would not undress myself but lay on thebedclothes and in half an hour stole out when i thought the crew wasat dinner and getting to the side of the ship was going to leap intothe sea and swim for my life rather than continue among yahoos  butone of the seamen prevented me and having informed the captain i waschained to my cabinafter dinner don pedro came to me and desired to know my reason for sodesperate an attempt assured me he only meant to do me all the servicehe was able and spoke so very movingly that at last i descended totreat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason  i gavehim a very short relation of my voyage of the conspiracy against me bymy own men of the country where they set me on shore and of my fiveyears residence there  all which he looked upon as if it were a dream ora vision whereat i took great offence for i had quite forgot thefaculty of lying so peculiar to yahoos in all countries where theypreside and consequently their disposition of suspecting truth inothers of their own species  i asked him whether it were the custom inhis country to say the thing which was not  i assured him i hadalmost forgot what he meant by falsehood and if i had lived a thousandyears in houyhnhnmland i should never have heard a lie from themeanest servant that i was altogether indifferent whether he believed meor not but however in return for his favours i would give so muchallowance to the corruption of his nature as to answer any objection hewould please to make and then he might easily discover the truththe captain a wise man after many endeavours to catch me tripping insome part of my story at last began to have a better opinion of myveracity  but he added that since i professed so inviolable anattachment to truth i must give him my word and honour to bear himcompany in this voyage without attempting any thing against my life orelse he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at lisbon  i gavehim the promise he required but at the same time protested that iwould suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live amongyahoosour voyage passed without any considerable accident  in gratitude to thecaptain i sometimes sat with him at his earnest request and strove toconceal my antipathy against human kind although it often broke outwhich he suffered to pass without observation  but the greatest part ofthe day i confined myself to my cabin to avoid seeing any of the crewthe captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dressand offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had  this i would notbe prevailed on to accept abhorring to cover myself with any thing thathad been on the back of a yahoo  i only desired he would lend me twoclean shirts which having been washed since he wore them i believedwould not so much defile me  these i changed every second day andwashed them myselfwe arrived at lisbon nov    at our landing the captain forcedme to cover myself with his cloak to prevent the rabble from crowdingabout me  i was conveyed to his own house and at my earnest request heled me up to the highest room backwards  i conjured him to conceal fromall persons what i had told him of the houyhnhnms because the leasthint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me butprobably put me in danger of being imprisoned or burnt by theinquisition  the captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newlymade but i would not suffer the tailor to take my measure however donpedro being almost of my size they fitted me well enough  he accoutredme with other necessaries all new which i aired for twentyfour hoursbefore i would use themthe captain had no wife nor above three servants none of which weresuffered to attend at meals and his whole deportment was so obligingadded to very good human understanding that i really began to toleratehis company  he gained so far upon me that i ventured to look out ofthe back window  by degrees i was brought into another room whence ipeeped into the street but drew my head back in a fright  in a weekstime he seduced me down to the door  i found my terror graduallylessened but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase  i was at lastbold enough to walk the street in his company but kept my nose wellstopped with rue or sometimes with tobaccoin ten days don pedro to whom i had given some account of my domesticaffairs put it upon me as a matter of honour and conscience that iought to return to my native country and live at home with my wife andchildren  he told me there was an english ship in the port just readyto sail and he would furnish me with all things necessary  it would betedious to repeat his arguments and my contradictions  he said it wasaltogether impossible to find such a solitary island as i desired to livein but i might command in my own house and pass my time in a manner asrecluse as i pleasedi complied at last finding i could not do better  i left lisbon theth day of november in an english merchantman but who was the master inever inquired  don pedro accompanied me to the ship and lent me twentypounds  he took kind leave of me and embraced me at parting which ibore as well as i could  during this last voyage i had no commerce withthe master or any of his men but pretending i was sick kept close inmy cabin  on the fifth of december  we cast anchor in the downsabout nine in the morning and at three in the afternoon i got safe to myhouse at rotherhith my wife and family received me with great surprise and joy because theyconcluded me certainly dead but i must freely confess the sight of themfilled me only with hatred disgust and contempt and the more byreflecting on the near alliance i had to them  for although since myunfortunate exile from the houyhnhnm country i had compelled myself totolerate the sight of yahoos and to converse with don pedro de mendezyet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtuesand ideas of those exalted houyhnhnms  and when i began to considerthat by copulating with one of the yahoo species i had become a parentof more it struck me with the utmost shame confusion and horroras soon as i entered the house my wife took me in her arms and kissedme at which having not been used to the touch of that odious animal forso many years i fell into a swoon for almost an hour  at the time i amwriting it is five years since my last return to england  during thefirst year i could not endure my wife or children in my presence thevery smell of them was intolerable much less could i suffer them to eatin the same room  to this hour they dare not presume to touch my breador drink out of the same cup neither was i ever able to let one of themtake me by the hand  the first money i laid out was to buy two youngstonehorses which i keep in a good stable and next to them the groomis my greatest favourite for i feel my spirits revived by the smell hecontracts in the stable  my horses understand me tolerably well iconverse with them at least four hours every day  they are strangers tobridle or saddle they live in great amity with me and friendship to eachotherchapter xiithe authors veracity  his design in publishing this work  his censureof those travellers who swerve from the truth  the author clears himselffrom any sinister ends in writing  an objection answered  the method ofplanting colonies  his native country commended  the right of the crownto those countries described by the author is justified  the difficultyof conquering them  the author takes his last leave of the readerproposes his manner of living for the future gives good advice andconcludesthus gentle reader i have given thee a faithful history of my travelsfor sixteen years and above seven months wherein i have not been sostudious of ornament as of truth  i could perhaps like others haveastonished thee with strange improbable tales but i rather chose torelate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style because myprincipal design was to inform and not to amuse theeit is easy for us who travel into remote countries which are seldomvisited by englishmen or other europeans to form descriptions ofwonderful animals both at sea and land  whereas a travellers chief aimshould be to make men wiser and better and to improve their minds by thebad as well as good example of what they deliver concerning foreignplacesi could heartily wish a law was enacted that every traveller before hewere permitted to publish his voyages should be obliged to make oathbefore the lord high chancellor that all he intended to print wasabsolutely true to the best of his knowledge for then the world would nolonger be deceived as it usually is while some writers to make theirworks pass the better upon the public impose the grossest falsities onthe unwary reader  i have perused several books of travels with greatdelight in my younger days but having since gone over most parts of theglobe and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my ownobservation it has given me a great disgust against this part ofreading and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind soimpudently abused  therefore since my acquaintance were pleased tothink my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country iimposed on myself as a maxim never to be swerved from that i wouldstrictly adhere to truth neither indeed can i be ever under the leasttemptation to vary from it while i retain in my mind the lectures andexample of my noble master and the other illustrious houyhnhnms of whomi had so long the honour to be an humble hearer    nec si miserum fortuna sinonem    finxit vanum etiam mendacemque improba fingeti know very well how little reputation is to be got by writings whichrequire neither genius nor learning nor indeed any other talent excepta good memory or an exact journal  i know likewise that writers oftravels like dictionarymakers are sunk into oblivion by the weight andbulk of those who come last and therefore lie uppermost  and it ishighly probable that such travellers who shall hereafter visit thecountries described in this work of mine may by detecting my errors ifthere be any and adding many new discoveries of their own justle meout of vogue and stand in my place making the world forget that ever iwas an author  this indeed would be too great a mortification if iwrote for fame but as my sole intention was the public good i cannot bealtogether disappointed  for who can read of the virtues i havementioned in the glorious houyhnhnms without being ashamed of his ownvices when he considers himself as the reasoning governing animal ofhis country  i shall say nothing of those remote nations where yahoospreside among which the least corrupted are the brobdingnagians whosewise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness toobserve  but i forbear descanting further and rather leave thejudicious reader to his own remarks and applicationi am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet withno censurers for what objections can be made against a writer whorelates only plain facts that happened in such distant countries wherewe have not the least interest with respect either to trade ornegotiations  i have carefully avoided every fault with which commonwriters of travels are often too justly charged  besides i meddle notthe least with any party but write without passion prejudice orillwill against any man or number of men whatsoever  i write for thenoblest end to inform and instruct mankind over whom i may withoutbreach of modesty pretend to some superiority from the advantages ireceived by conversing so long among the most accomplished houyhnhnmsi write without any view to profit or praise  i never suffer a word topass that may look like reflection or possibly give the least offenceeven to those who are most ready to take it  so that i hope i may withjustice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless against whom thetribes of answerers considerers observers reflectors detectorsremarkers will never be able to find matter for exercising theirtalentsi confess it was whispered to me that i was bound in duty as asubject of england to have given in a memorial to a secretary of stateat my first coming over because whatever lands are discovered by asubject belong to the crown  but i doubt whether our conquests in thecountries i treat of would be as easy as those of ferdinando cortez overthe naked americans  the lilliputians i think are hardly worth thecharge of a fleet and army to reduce them and i question whether itmight be prudent or safe to attempt the brobdingnagians or whether anenglish army would be much at their ease with the flying island overtheir heads  the houyhnhnms indeed appear not to be so well preparedfor war a science to which they are perfect strangers and especiallyagainst missive weapons  however supposing myself to be a minister ofstate i could never give my advice for invading them  their prudenceunanimity unacquaintedness with fear and their love of their countrywould amply supply all defects in the military art  imagine twentythousand of them breaking into the midst of an european army confoundingthe ranks overturning the carriages battering the warriors faces intomummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs for they would welldeserve the character given to augustus recalcitrat undique tutusbut instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation irather wish they were in a capacity or disposition to send a sufficientnumber of their inhabitants for civilizing europe by teaching us thefirst principles of honour justice truth temperance public spiritfortitude chastity friendship benevolence and fidelity  the names ofall which virtues are still retained among us in most languages and areto be met with in modern as well as ancient authors which i am able toassert from my own small readingbut i had another reason which made me less forward to enlarge hismajestys dominions by my discoveries  to say the truth i had conceiveda few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes uponthose occasions  for instance a crew of pirates are driven by a stormthey know not whither at length a boy discovers land from the topmastthey go on shore to rob and plunder they see a harmless people areentertained with kindness they give the country a new name they takeformal possession of it for their king they set up a rotten plank or astone for a memorial they murder two or three dozen of the nativesbring away a couple more by force for a sample return home and gettheir pardon  here commences a new dominion acquired with a title bydivine right  ships are sent with the first opportunity the nativesdriven out or destroyed their princes tortured to discover their gold afree license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust the earth reekingwith the blood of its inhabitants and this execrable crew of butchersemployed in so pious an expedition is a modern colony sent to convertand civilize an idolatrous and barbarous peoplebut this description i confess does by no means affect the britishnation who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom careand justice in planting colonies their liberal endowments for theadvancement of religion and learning their choice of devout and ablepastors to propagate christianity their caution in stocking theirprovinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this themother kingdom their strict regard to the distribution of justice insupplying the civil administration through all their colonies withofficers of the greatest abilities utter strangers to corruption andto crown all by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors whohave no other views than the happiness of the people over whom theypreside and the honour of the king their masterbut as those countries which i have described do not appear to have anydesire of being conquered and enslaved murdered or driven out bycolonies nor abound either in gold silver sugar or tobacco i didhumbly conceive they were by no means proper objects of our zeal ourvalour or our interest  however if those whom it more concerns thinkfit to be of another opinion i am ready to depose when i shall belawfully called that no european did ever visit those countries beforeme  i mean if the inhabitants ought to be believed unless a disputemay arise concerning the two yahoos said to have been seen many yearsago upon a mountain in houyhnhnmlandbut as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereigns name itnever came once into my thoughts and if it had yet as my affairs thenstood i should perhaps in point of prudence and selfpreservation haveput it off to a better opportunityhaving thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised againstme as a traveller i here take a final leave of all my courteous readersand return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at redriffto apply those excellent lessons of virtue which i learned among thehouyhnhnms to instruct the yahoos of my own family is far as ishall find them docible animals to behold my figure often in a glassand thus if possible habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight ofa human creature to lament the brutality to houyhnhnms in my owncountry but always treat their persons with respect for the sake of mynoble master his family his friends and the whole houyhnhnm racewhom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineamentshowever their intellectuals came to degeneratei began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me at thefarthest end of a long table and to answer but with the utmost brevitythe few questions i asked her  yet the smell of a yahoo continuingvery offensive i always keep my nose well stopped with rue lavender ortobacco leaves  and although it be hard for a man late in life toremove old habits i am not altogether out of hopes in some time tosuffer a neighbour yahoo in my company without the apprehensions i amyet under of his teeth or his clawsmy reconcilement to the yahoo kind in general might not be sodifficult if they would be content with those vices and follies onlywhich nature has entitled them to  i am not in the least provoked at thesight of a lawyer a pickpocket a colonel a fool a lord a gamester apolitician a whoremonger a physician an evidence a suborner anattorney a traitor or the like this is all according to the due courseof things but when i behold a lump of deformity and diseases both inbody and mind smitten with pride it immediately breaks all the measuresof my patience neither shall i be ever able to comprehend how such ananimal and such a vice could tally together  the wise and virtuoushouyhnhnms who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rationalcreature have no name for this vice in their language which has noterms to express any thing that is evil except those whereby theydescribe the detestable qualities of their yahoos among which theywere not able to distinguish this of pride for want of thoroughlyunderstanding human nature as it shows itself in other countries wherethat animal presides  but i who had more experience could plainlyobserve some rudiments of it among the wild yahoosbut the houyhnhnms who live under the government of reason are nomore proud of the good qualities they possess than i should be for notwanting a leg or an arm which no man in his wits would boast ofalthough he must be miserable without them  i dwell the longer upon thissubject from the desire i have to make the society of an english yahooby any means not insupportable and therefore i here entreat those whohave any tincture of this absurd vice that they will not presume to comein my sightfootnotes  a stang is a pole or perch sixteen feet
